    # Define the MutableMapping abstract methods
    #

    #
    # Currently __setitem__ only supports assignment of an explicit
    # instantiation of the interface datatype. Updates to an already
    # existing object inside this container need to be done via that
    # objects interface methods or by directly accessing object
    # attributes.
    #
    # * Note about implicit instantiation / update:
    #    Implicit instantiation or update using assignment of a valid
    #    value type could be supported, but we should more carefully
    #    consider edge cases before guaranteeing such functionality.
    #    The explicit approach provides all functionality one would
    #    need, albeit, with a slightly more verbose syntax (which one
    #    could argue is more clear).
    #
    # * Note about component ownership
    #    Currently this method only supports assignment of datatype
    #    instantiations whose parent component has not been set. This
    #    prevents the current container from "stealing" the component
    #    from a different container, leaving the old container still
    #    thinking all components it contains have their weakref
    #    pointing back to itself.
    #
    #    However, it is not clear that this would actually be an
    #    issue.  For instance, this would seem like a very effective
    #    way of "aliasing" a variable. That is, this component would
    #    only set the parent component on an incoming object
    #    assignment if that object was not already assigned a
    #    parent. All of the problem writers would not be effected by
    #    this because they generate the symbol map by hashing off of
    #    the object id(). This would also seamlessly integrate into
    #    the Suffix API as that component hashes of off id() as well.
    #
    #    Again, I would rather start with more limited functionality
    #    that we could all, without question, agree on, so this is
    #    something to consider later on.
