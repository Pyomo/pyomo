        # for key, val in self.__dict__.iteritems():

        # singleton component -- in which case it also has a __dict__).
        # Plus, this may be a derived class with several layers of
        # slots.  So, we will piggyback on the __getstate__/__setstate__
        # logic amd resort to partially "pickling" the object,
        # deepcopying the state, and then restoring the copy into
        # the new instance.
        #
        # [JDS 7/7/14] I worry about the efficiency of using both
        # getstate/setstate *and* deepcopy, but we need deepcopy to
        # update the _parent refs appropriately, and since this is a
        # slot-ized class, we cannot overwrite the __deepcopy__
        # attribute to prevent infinite recursion.
        #
        # deepcopy() is an inherently recursive operation.  This can
        # cause problems for highly interconnected Pyomo models (for
        # example, a time linked model where each time block has a
        # linking constraint [in the time block] to the next / previous
        # block).  This would effectively put the entire time horizon on
        # the stack.  To avoid this, we will leverage the useful
        # knowledge that all component references point to other
        # components / component datas, and NOT to attributes on the
        # components/datas.  So, if we can first go through and stub in
        # all the objects that we will need to populate, and then go
        # through and deepcopy them, then we can unroll the vast
        # majority of the recursion.

        #
        # Now that we have created (but not populated) all the
        # components that we expect to need, we can go through and
        # populate all the components.
        #
        # The component_list is roughly in declaration order.  This
        # means that it should be relatively safe to clone the contents
        # in the same order.
        #
        # There is a particularly subtle bug with 'uncopyable'
        # attributes: if the exception is thrown while copying a complex
        # data structure, we can be in a state where objects have been
        # created and assigned to the memo in the try block, but they
        # haven't had their state set yet.  When the exception moves us
        # into the except block, we need to effectively "undo" those
        # partially copied classes.  The only way is to restore the memo
        # to the state it was in before we started.  We will make use of
        # the knowledge that 1) memo entries are never reassigned during
        # a deepcopy(), and 2) dict are ordered by insertion order in
        # Python >= 3.7.  As a result, we do not need to preserve the
        # whole memo before calling __getstate__/__setstate__, and can
        # get away with only remembering the number of items in the
        # memo.
        #
        # Note that entering/leaving try-except contexts has a
        # not-insignificant overhead.  On the hope that the user wrote a

    This is the base class for the component data used
    in Pyomo modeling components that can be activated and
    deactivated.

    It's possible to end up in a state where the parent Component
    has _active=True but all ComponentData have _active=False. This
    seems like a reasonable state, though we cannot easily detect
    this situation.  The important thing to avoid is the situation
    where one or more ComponentData are active, but the parent
    Component claims active=False. This class structure is designed
    to prevent this situation.

    Constructor arguments:
        owner           The component that owns this data object

    Private class attributes:
        _component      A weakref to the component that owns this data object
        _index          The index of this data object
        _active         A boolean that indicates whether this data is active
