Pyomo Model Components:
----------------------------------------------------------------

 AbstractModel
    An abstract optimization model that defers construction of
    components.

 Block
    A component that contains one or more model components.

 BuildAction
    A component that performs arbitrary actions during model
    construction.  The action rule is applied to every index
    value.

 BuildCheck
    A component that performs tests during model construction.
    The action rule is applied to every index value.

 Complementarity
    Complementarity conditions.

 ConcreteModel
    A concrete optimization model that does not defer
    construction of components.

 Connector
    A bundle of variables that can be manipulated together.

 Constraint
    General constraint expressions.

 ConstraintList
    A list of constraint expressions.

 ContinuousSet
    A sequence of numeric values defining the range over which
    a differential equation is to be discretized and solved.

 DerivativeVar
    Derivative of a State variable in a DAE model.

 Disjunct
    Disjunctive blocks.

 Disjunction
    Disjunction expressions.

 Expression
    Named expressions that can be used in other expressions.

 Integral
    Integral Expression in a DAE model.

 Model
    Model objects can be used as a component of other models.

 Objective
    Expressions that are minimized or maximized.

 ObjectiveList
    A list of objectives.

 Param
    Parameter data that is used to define a model instance.

 Piecewise
    Constraints that contain piecewise linear expressions.

 RangeSet
    A sequence of numeric values.  RangeSet(start,end,step) is
    a sequence starting a value 'start', and increasing in
    values by 'step' until a value greater than or equal to
    'end' is reached.

 SOSConstraint
    SOS constraint expressions.

 Set
    Set data that is used to define a model instance.

 SetOf
    Define a Pyomo Set component using an iterable data object.

 StateVar
    State variable in a DAE model.

 SubModel
    A submodel in a bilevel program

 Suffix
    Declare a container for extraneous model data

 Var
    Decision variables.

 VarList
    List of decision variables.
