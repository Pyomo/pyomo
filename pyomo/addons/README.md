# Pyomo Addons

The `pyomo.addons` directory contains **mostly stable extensions** to Pyomo
that are **not part of the core library**. These packages extend Pyomo's
modeling, solver, and analysis capabilities, and have demonstrated sufficient
maturity, documentation, and testing.

The **authoritative contribution guidelines** for `pyomo.addons`, including
testing, documentation, and dependency expectations, are maintained in the
[Contribution Guide](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution_guide.html).

## Examples

Current addons include:

- `gdpopt`
- `incidence_analysis`
- `latex_printer`
- `trustregion`
- `viewer`
