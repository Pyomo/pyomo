class ContinuousSet(OrderedSimpleSet):
    """ Represents a bounded continuous domain

        Minimally, this set must contain two numeric values defining the
        bounds of a continuous range. Discrete points of interest may
        be added to the continuous set. A continuous set is one
        dimensional and may only contain numerical values.

        Parameters
        ----------
        initialize : `list`
            Default discretization points to be included

        bounds : `tuple`
            The bounding points for the continuous domain. The bounds will
            be included as discrete points in the :py:class:`ContinuousSet`
            but will not be used to restrict points added to the
            :py:class:`ContinuousSet` through the 'initialize' argument,
            a data file, or the add() method

        Attributes
        ----------
        _changed : `boolean`
            This keeps track of whether or not the ContinuousSet was changed
            during discretization. If the user specifies all of the needed
            discretization points before the discretization then there is no
            need to go back through the model and reconstruct things indexed
            by the :py:class:`ContinuousSet`

        _fe : `list`
            This is a sorted list of the finite element points in the
            :py:class:`ContinuousSet`. i.e. this list contains all the
            discrete points in the :py:class:`ContinuousSet` that are not
            collocation points. Points that are both finite element points
            and collocation points will be included in this list.

        _discretization_info : `dict`
            This is a dictionary which contains information on the
            discretization transformation which has been applied to the
            :py:class:`ContinuousSet`.
