    Represents derivatives in a model and defines how a
    :py:class:`Var<pyomo.environ.Var>` is differentiated

    The :py:class:`DerivativeVar <pyomo.dae.DerivativeVar>` component is
    used to declare a derivative of a :py:class:`Var <pyomo.environ.Var>`.
    The constructor accepts a single positional argument which is the
    :py:class:`Var<pyomo.environ.Var>` that's being differentiated. A
    :py:class:`Var <pyomo.environ.Var>` may only be differentiated with
    respect to a :py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` that it
    is indexed by. The indexing sets of a :py:class:`DerivativeVar
    <pyomo.dae.DerivativeVar>` are identical to those of the :py:class:`Var
    <pyomo.environ.Var>` it is differentiating.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sVar : ``pyomo.environ.Var``
        The variable being differentiated

    wrt : ``pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet`` or tuple
        Equivalent to `withrespectto` keyword argument. The
        :py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` that the
        derivative is being taken with respect to. Higher order derivatives
        are represented by including the
        :py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` multiple times in
        the tuple sent to this keyword. i.e. ``wrt=(m.t, m.t)`` would be the
        second order derivative with respect to ``m.t``
