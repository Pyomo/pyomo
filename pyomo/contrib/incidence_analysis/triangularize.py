    The provided undirected bipartite graph is projected into a directed graph
    on the set of "top nodes" by treating "matched edges" as out-edges and
    "unmatched edges" as in-edges. Then the strongly connected components of
    the directed graph are computed. These strongly connected components are
    unique, regardless of the choice of perfect matching. The strongly connected
    components form a directed acyclic graph, and are returned in a topological
    order. The order is unique, as ambiguities are resolved "lexicographically".

    The "direction" of the projection (where matched edges are out-edges)
    leads to a block *lower* triangular permutation when the top nodes
    correspond to *rows* in the bipartite graph of a matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    matrix: ``scipy.sparse.coo_matrix``

       **Breaking change in Pyomo 6.5.0**

       The pre-6.5.0 ``block_triangularize`` function returned maps from
       each row or column to the index of its block in a block
       lower triangularization as the original intent of this function
       was to identify when coordinates do or don't share a diagonal block
       in this partition. Since then, the dominant use case of
       ``block_triangularize`` has been to partition variables and
       constraints into these blocks and inspect or solve each block
       individually. A natural return type for this functionality is the
       ordered partition of rows and columns, as lists of lists.
       This functionality was previously available via the
       ``get_diagonal_blocks`` method, which was confusing as it did not
       capture that the partition was the diagonal of a block
       *triangularization* (as opposed to diagonalization). The pre-6.5.0
       functionality of ``block_triangularize`` is still available via the
       ``map_coords_to_block_triangular_indices`` function.
