    These diagonal blocks correspond to strongly connected components of the
    bipartite incidence graph, projected with respect to a perfect matching

    Parameters
    ----------
    constraints: List of Pyomo constraint data objects
        Constraints used to generate strongly connected components.
    variables: List of Pyomo variable data objects
        Variables that may participate in strongly connected components.

    include_fixed: Bool
        Indicates whether fixed variables will be included when
        identifying variables in constraints.

    Yields
    ------
    ``_BlockData``
        Blocks containing the variables and constraints of every strongly
        connected component, in a topological order, as well as the

    """Solve a square system of variables and equality constraints by
    solving strongly connected components individually.

    Strongly connected components (of the directed graph of constraints
    obtained from a perfect matching of variables and constraints) are
    the diagonal blocks in a block triangularization of the incidence
    matrix, so solving the strongly connected components in topological
    order is sufficient to solve the entire block.

    One-by-one blocks are solved using Pyomo's
    calculate_variable_from_constraint function, while higher-dimension
    blocks are solved using the user-provided solver object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    block: Pyomo Block
        The Pyomo block whose variables and constraints will be solved
    solver: Pyomo solver object
        The solver object that will be used to solve strongly connected
        components of size greater than one constraint. Must implement
        a solve method.
