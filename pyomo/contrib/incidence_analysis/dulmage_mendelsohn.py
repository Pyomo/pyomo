def dulmage_mendelsohn(matrix_or_graph, top_nodes=None, matching=None):
    """Partition a bipartite graph or incidence matrix according to the
    Dulmage-Mendelsohn characterization

    The Dulmage-Mendelsohn partition tells which nodes of the two bipartite
    sets *can possibly be* unmatched after a maximum cardinality matching.
    Applied to an incidence matrix, it can be interpreted as partitioning
    rows and columns into under-constrained, over-constrained, and
    well-constrained subsystems.

    As it is often useful to explicitly check the unmatched rows and columns,
    ``dulmage_mendelsohn`` partitions rows into the subsets:

    - **underconstrained** - The rows matched with *possibly* unmatched
      columns (unmatched and underconstrained columns)
    - **square** - The well-constrained rows, which are matched with
      well-constrained columns
    - **overconstrained** - The matched rows that *can possibly be* unmatched
      in some maximum cardinality matching
    - **unmatched** - The unmatched rows in a particular maximum cardinality
      matching

    and partitions columns into the subsets:

    - **unmatched** - The unmatched columns in a particular maximum cardinality
      matching
    - **underconstrained** - The columns that *can possibly be* unmatched in
      some maximum cardinality matching
    - **square** - The well-constrained columns, which are matched with
      well-constrained rows
    - **overconstrained** - The columns matched with *possibly* unmatched
      rows (unmatched and overconstrained rows)

    Parameters
    ----------
    matrix_or_graph: ``scipy.sparse.coo_matrix`` or ``networkx.Graph``
        The incidence matrix or bipartite graph to be partitioned
    top_nodes: list
        List of nodes in one bipartite set of the graph. Must be provided
        if a graph is provided.
    matching: dict
        A maximum cardinality matching in the form of a dict mapping
        from "top nodes" to their matched nodes *and* from the matched
        nodes back to the "top nodes".

    Returns
    -------
    row_dmp: RowPartition
        The Dulmage-Mendelsohn partition of rows
    col_dmp: ColPartition
        The Dulmage-Mendelsohn partition of columns
