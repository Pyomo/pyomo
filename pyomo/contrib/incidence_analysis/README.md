### Pyomo variable-constraint matching tools
This contrib package includes functions for analyzing the
structure of a variable-constraint graph (or incidence matrix)
from a Pyomo model. This is useful for verifying the non-singularity
of a subset of variables and constraints, as one might want to do
for differential-algebraic equation models.
