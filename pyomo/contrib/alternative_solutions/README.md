# alternative_solutions

pyomo.contrib.alternative_solutions is a collection of functions that
that generate a set of alternative (near-)optimal solutions
(AOS).  These functions rely on a pyomo solver to search for solutions,
and they iteratively adapt the search process to find a variety of
alternative solutions.
