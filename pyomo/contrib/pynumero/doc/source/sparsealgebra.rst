Sparse Linear Algebra and Matrix Vector Storage
===============================================

Matrix vector operations are fundamental for the development of any numerical algorithm. Numpy is a popular Python package that provides functionality to store and manipulate n-dimensional arrays of data, with most of the operations being performed in compiled code. Over the years, the efficiency and flexibility of Numpy has made the package an essential library for most of today's scientific/mathematical Python-based software. Scipy is another popular Python package for scientific computing which builds on Numpy to provide a collection of common numerical routines (also pre-compiled) and sparse matrix storage schemes. To exploit the capabilities of the Numpy/ Scipy ecosystem, PyNumero stores vectors and matrices from the NLP interface in Numpy arrays and Scipy sparse matrices. By doing so, PyNumero benefits from the fast pre-compiled operations of Numpy (e.g. vectorization and broadcasting), makes all subroutines in Numpy/Scipy available for implementing optimization algorithms, and minimizes the burden on users to learn additional syntax besides what is offered in Numpy/Scipy.
