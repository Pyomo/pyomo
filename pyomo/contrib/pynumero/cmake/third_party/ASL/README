PyNumero relies on a patched version of the ASL that supports direct
memory transfer of the NL file.  The included getASL.sh script automates
the process of fetching and patching the ASL source.

Quick installations for fetching and building the ASL:

      ./getASL.sh
      cd solvers
      ./configurehere
      make

If your networking environment prevents the secure download of the ASL
from GitHub, you can run the download "insecurely" with:

     ./getASL.sh --insecure
