"""
This module is used for interfacing an external model as
a block in a Pyomo model.

An ExternalGreyBoxModel is model is a model that does not
provide constraints explicitly as algebraic expressions, but
instead provides a set of methods that can compute the residuals
of the constraints (or outputs) and their derivatives.

This allows one to interface external codes (e.g., compiled
external models) with a Pyomo model.

Note: To solve a Pyomo model that contains these external models
      we have a specialized interface built on PyNumero that provides
      an interface to the CyIpopt solver.

To use this interface:
   * Create a class that is derived from ExternalGreyBoxModel and
     implement the necessary methods. This derived class must provide
     a list of names for: the inputs to your model, the equality constraints
     (or residuals) that need to be converged, and any outputs that
     are computed from your model. It will also need to provide methods to
     compute the residuals, outputs, and the jacobian of these with respect to
     the inputs. Implement the methods to evaluate hessians if applicable.
     See the documentation on ExternalGreyBoxModel for more details.

   * Create a Pyomo model and make use of the ExternalGreyBoxBlock
     to produce a Pyomo modeling component that represents your
     external model. This block is a Pyomo component, and when you
     call set_external_model() and provide an instance of your derived
     ExternalGreyBoxModel, it will automatically create pyomo variables to
     represent the inputs and the outputs from the external model. You
     can implement a callback to modify the Pyomo block after it is
     constructed. This also provides a mechanism to initalize variables,
     etc.

   * Create a PyomoGreyBoxNLP and provide it with the Pyomo model
     that contains the ExternalGreyBoxBlocks. This class presents
     an NLP interface (i.e., the PyNumero NLP abstract class), and
     can be used with any solver that makes use of this interface
     (e.g., the CyIpopt solver interface provided in PyNumero)

See pyomo/contrib/pynumero/examples/external_grey_box for examples
of the use of this interface.

Note:

   * Currently, you cannot "fix" a pyomo variable that corresponds to an
     input or output and you must use a constraint instead (this is
     because Pyomo removes fixed variables before sending them to the
     solver)

"""

class ExternalGreyBoxModel(object):
    """
    This is the base class for building external input output models
    for use with Pyomo and CyIpopt. See the module documentation above,
    and documentation of individual methods.

    There are examples in:
    pyomo/contrib/pynumero/examples/external_grey_box/react-example/

    Most methods are documented in the class itself. However, there are
    methods that are not implemented in the base class that may need
    to be implemented to provide support for certain features.

    Hessian support:

    If you would like to support Hessian computations for your
    external model, you will need to implement the following methods to
    support setting the multipliers that are used when computing the
    Hessian of the Lagrangian.
    - set_equality_constraint_multipliers: see documentation in method
    - set_output_constraint_multipliers: see documentation in method
    You will also need to implement the following methods to evaluate
    the required Hessian information:

    def evaluate_hessian_equality_constraints(self):
        Compute the product of the equality constraint multipliers
        with the hessian of the equality constraints.
        E.g., y_eq^k is the vector of equality constraint multipliers
        from set_equality_constraint_multipliers, w_eq(u)=0 are the
        equality constraints, and u^k are the vector of inputs from
        set_inputs. This method must return
        H_eq^k = sum_i (y_eq^k)_i * grad^2_{uu} w_eq(u^k)

    def evaluate_hessian_outputs(self):
        Compute the product of the output constraint multipliers with the
        hessian of the outputs. E.g., y_o^k is the vector of output
        constraint multipliers from set_output_constraint_multipliers,
        u^k are the vector of inputs from set_inputs, and w_o(u) is the
        function that computes the vector of outputs at the values for
        the input variables. This method must return
        H_o^k = sum_i (y_o^k)_i * grad^2_{uu} w_o(u^k)

    Examples that show Hessian support are also found in:
    pyomo/contrib/pynumero/examples/external_grey_box/react-example/
