"""
The purpose of this file is to perform feasibility based bounds 
tightening. This is a very basic implementation, but it is done 
directly with pyomo expressions. The only functions that are meant to 
be used by users are fbbt and compute_bounds_on_expr. The first set of 
functions in this file (those with names starting with 
_prop_bnds_leaf_to_root) are used for propagating bounds from the  
variables to each node in the expression tree (all the way to the  
root node). The second set of functions (those with names starting 
with _prop_bnds_root_to_leaf) are used to propagate bounds from the 
constraint back to the variables. For example, consider the constraint 
x*y + z == 1 with -1 <= x <= 1 and -2 <= y <= 2. When propagating 
bounds from the variables to the root (the root is x*y + z), we find 
that -2 <= x*y <= 2, and that -inf <= x*y + z <= inf. However, 
from the constraint, we know that 1 <= x*y + z <= 1, so we may 
propagate bounds back to the variables. Since we know that 
1 <= x*y + z <= 1 and -2 <= x*y <= 2, then we must have -1 <= z <= 3. 
However, bounds cannot be improved on x*y, so bounds cannot be 
improved on either x or y.

>>> m.y = pe.Var(bounds=(-2,2))
>>> m.z = pe.Var()
>>> from pyomo.contrib.fbbt.fbbt import fbbt
>>> m.c = pe.Constraint(expr=m.x*m.y + m.z == 1)

    This function is a bit complicated. A simpler implementation

    and the bounds_on_sum_of_args_excluding_arg_i could be computed

    approximately quadratically with the length of the sum. Thus,

    [(x1)_bounds, (x1+x2)_bounds, (x1+x2+x3)_bounds, (x1+x2+x3+x4)_bounds]

        every constraint in the Block. We then attempt to identify which constraints to repeat FBBT on based on the
