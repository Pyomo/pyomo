# Engineering Design Interface

The Pyomo Engineering Design Interface (EDI) is a lightweight wrapper on the Pyomo language that is targeted at composing engineering design optimization problems.  The language and interface have been designed to mimic many of the features found in [GPkit](https://github.com/convexengineering/gpkit) and [CVXPY](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy) while also providing a simple, clean interface for black-box analysis codes that are common in engineering design applications.

## TODO
- Add unit tests for the BlackBox_Standardized method
- Add unit tests for the MultiCase method
- Add documentation for the MultiCase method
- Address Bethany's comments

## Installation

EDI is a part of the standard installation process for Pyomo:
```
pip install pyomo
```

EDI also requires the pint dependency that is optional in base Pyomo:
```
pip install pint
```

## Usage

The core object in EDI is the `Formulation`  object, which inherits from the `pyomo.environ.ConcreteModel`.  Essentially, a `Formulation` is a Pyomo `Model` with some extra stuff, but can be treated exactly as if it were a Pyomo `Model`.  However, an EDI `Formulation` has some additional features that can help simplify model construction.

<!-- Below is a simple example to get started, but additional resources can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/Pyomo/pyomo/tree/main/pyomo/contrib/edi/examples) folder or in the EDI [documentation](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributed_packages/edi/index.html) -->

        # Declare the black box model outputs
        self.outputs.append(name = 'z', units = 'ft**2',  description = 'Resultant of the unit circle evaluation')

        # Declare the maximum available derivative
        self.availableDerivative = 1

        # Post-initialization setup
        self.post_init_setup()

    def BlackBox(self, x, y): # The actual function that does things
        x = pyo.value(units.convert(x,self.inputs['x'].units)) # Converts to correct units then casts to float
        y = pyo.value(units.convert(y,self.inputs['y'].units)) # Converts to correct units then casts to float

        z = x**2 + y**2 # Compute z
        dzdx = 2*x      # Compute dz/dx
        dzdy = 2*y      # Compute dz/dy

        z *= units.ft**2
        dzdx *= units.ft # units.ft**2 / units.ft
        dzdy *= units.ft # units.ft**2 / units.ft
        
        return z, [dzdx, dzdy] # return z, grad(z), hess(z)...

# =======================
# Declare the Constraints
