# Engineering Design Interface

The Pyomo Engineering Design Interface (EDI) is a lightweight wrapper on the Pyomo language that is targeted at composing engineering design optimization problems.  The language and interface have been designed to mimic many of the features found in [GPkit](https://github.com/convexengineering/gpkit) and [CVXPY](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy) while also providing a simple, clean interface for black-box analysis codes that are common in engineering design applications.

## Installation

EDI follows the standard installation process for Pyomo extensions:
```
pip install pyomo
pyomo download-extensions
pyomo build-extensions
```

## Usage

The core object in EDI is the `Formulation`  object, which inherits from the `pyomo.environ.ConcreteModel`.  Essentally, a `Formulation` is a Pyomo `Model` with some extra stuff, but can be treated exactly as if it were a Pyomo `Model`.  However, an EDI `Formulation` has some additional features that can help simplify model construction.

Below is a simple example to get started, but additional resources can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/Pyomo/pyomo/tree/main/pyomo/contrib/edi/examples) folder or in the EDI [documentation](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributed_packages/edi/index.html)
