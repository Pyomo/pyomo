    """Decomposition solver for Generalized Disjunctive Programming (GDP)
    problems.

    The GDPopt (Generalized Disjunctive Programming optimizer) solver applies a
    variety of decomposition-based approaches to solve Generalized Disjunctive
    Programming (GDP) problems. GDP models can include nonlinear, continuous
    variables and constraints, as well as logical conditions.

    These approaches include:

    - Logic-based outer approximation (LOA)
    - Logic-based branch-and-bound (LBB)
    - Partial surrogate cuts [pending]
    - Generalized Bender decomposition [pending]

    This solver implementation was developed by Carnegie Mellon University in
    the research group of Ignacio Grossmann.

    For nonconvex problems, LOA may not report rigorous lower/upper bounds.

    Questions: Please make a post at StackOverflow and/or contact Qi Chen
    <https://github.com/qtothec> or David Bernal <https://github.com/bernalde>.

    Several key GDPopt components were prototyped by BS and MS students:

    - Logic-based branch and bound: Sunjeev Kale
    - MC++ interface: Johnny Bates
    - LOA set-covering initialization: Eloy Fernandez
    - Logic-to-linear transformation: Romeo Valentin
