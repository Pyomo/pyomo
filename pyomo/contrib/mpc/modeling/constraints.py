def get_piecewise_constant_constraints(inputs, time, sample_points, use_next=True):
    """Returns an IndexedConstraint that constrains the provided variables
    to be constant between the provided sample points

    Arguments
    ---------
    inputs: list of variables
        Time-indexed variables that will be constrained piecewise constant
    time: Set
        Set of points at which provided variables will be constrained
    sample_points: List of floats
        Points at which "constant constraints" will be omitted; these are
        points at which the provided variables may vary.
    use_next: Bool (default True)
        Whether the next time point will be used in the constant constraint
        at each point in time. Otherwise, the previous time point is used.

    Returns
    -------
    Set, IndexedConstraint
        A RangeSet indexing the list of variables provided and a Constraint
        indexed by the product of this RangeSet and time.
