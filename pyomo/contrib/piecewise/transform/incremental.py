    The incremental MIP formulation of a piecewise-linear function, as described
    by [1]. To work in the multivariate case, the underlying triangulation must
    satisfy these properties:
     (1) The simplices are ordered T_1, ..., T_N such that T_i has nonempty intersection
         with T_{i+1}. It doesn't have to be a whole face; just a vertex is enough.
     (2) On each simplex T_i, the vertices are ordered T_i^1, ..., T_i^n such
         that T_i^n = T_{i+1}^1
    In Pyomo, the Triangulation.OrderedJ1 triangulation is compatible with this
    transformation.
