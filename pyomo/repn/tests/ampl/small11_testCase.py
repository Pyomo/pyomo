# Author:  Gabe Hackebeil
# Purpose: For regression testing to ensure that the Pyomo
#          NL writer properly labels constraint ids in the "J"
#          section of the NL file when trivial constraints exist.
#          At the creation of this test, trivial constraints
#          (constraints with no variables) are being written to
#          the nl file as a feasibility check for the user.
#
#          This test model relies on the gjh_asl_json executable. It
#          will not solve if sent to a real optimizer.
