# Purpose: For regression testing to ensure that the Pyomo
#          NL writer properly modifies product expressions
#          with only constant terms in the denominator (that
#          are involved in nonlinear expressions).
#          The ASL differentiation routines seem to have a
#          bug that causes the lagrangian hessian to become
#          dense unless this constant term in moved to the
#          numerator.
#
#          This test model relies on the gjh_asl_json executable. It
#          will not solve if sent to a real optimizer.
