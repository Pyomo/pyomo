# Purpose: For regression testing to ensure that the Pyomo
#          NL writer properly modifies product expressions
#          with only constant terms in the denominator (that
#          are involved in linear expressions).
#
#          This test model relies on the gjh_asl_json executable. It
#          will not solve if sent to a real optimizer.
