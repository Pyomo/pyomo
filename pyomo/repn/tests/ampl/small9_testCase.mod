# Purpose: For regression testing to ensure that the Pyomo
#          NL writer properly reclassifies nonlinear expressions
#          as linear or trivial when fixing variables or params
#          cause such a situation.
#
#          This test model relies on the gjh_asl_json executable. It
#          will not solve if sent to a real optimizer.
