cutpoint_set.py

Temporary file for parsing cutpoints from a cutpoint file.
Files are going to have the following structure:
Cutpointvectors(cpts_names, name)
wide 0.0 widelow 0.1 widemid 0.9 widehigh 1.0
wideskew1 0.0 widesk1low 0.05 widesk1mid 0.85 widesk1high 1.0
wideskew2 0.0 widesk2low 0.1 widesk2mid 0.95 widesk2high 1.0
quick 0.0 quicklow 0.5 quickhigh 1.0

The cutpoint sets must immediately follow the line "Cutpointvectors(cpts_names, name)
