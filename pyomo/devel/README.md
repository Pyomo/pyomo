# Pyomo Devel

The `pyomo.devel` directory contains **experimental, research-oriented, or
rapidly evolving** extensions to Pyomo. These packages are **not guaranteed to
be stable** and may change or be removed between releases **without
deprecation warnings**.

The **authoritative contribution guidelines** for `pyomo.devel`, including
testing, documentation, and dependency expectations, are maintained in the
[Contribution Guide](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution_guide.html).

## Examples

This directory contains a variety of experimental packages, such as:

- `doe`
- `piecewise`
- `solver`
- `sensitivity_toolbox`

Some of these may later graduate to `pyomo.addons` once they mature.
