# PauseGC is a class for clean, scoped management of the Python
# garbage collector.  To disable the GC for the duration of a
# scoped block use PauseGC in combination with the Python 'with'
# statement. E.g.,
#
# def my_func():
#    with PauseGC() as pgc:
#       [...]
#
# When the instance falls out of scope (by termination or exception),
# the GC will be re-enabled (if it was not initially disabled).  It is
# safe to nest instances of PauseGC That is, you don't have to worry
# if an outer function/method has its own instance of PauseGC.
