Preview capabilities through ``pyomo.__future__``
=================================================

This module provides a uniform interface for gaining access to future
("preview") capabilities that are either slightly incompatible with the
current official offering, or are still under development with the
intent to replace the current offering.

Currently supported ``__future__`` offerings include:

.. autosummary::

   solver_factory

.. autofunction:: solver_factory

    """Get (or set) the active implementation of the SolverFactory

    This allows users to query / set the current implementation of the
    SolverFactory that should be used throughout Pyomo.  Valid options are:

    - ``1``: the original Pyomo SolverFactory
    - ``2``: the SolverFactory from APPSI
    - ``3``: the SolverFactory from pyomo.contrib.solver

    The current active version can be obtained by calling the method
    with no arguments

    .. doctest::

        >>> from pyomo.__future__ import solver_factory
        >>> solver_factory()

    The active factory can be set either by passing the appropriate
    version to this function:

    .. doctest::

        >>> solver_factory(3)
        <pyomo.contrib.solver.factory.SolverFactoryClass object ...>

    or by importing the "special" name:
