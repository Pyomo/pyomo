# Pyomo Unsupported

_Beware! Here there be dragons!_

The `pyomo.unsupported` directory contains contributions that no longer have an active
maintainer nor any future development plans. Functionality under this namespace
may not work and is **NOT** tested through the standard test harness.

The **authoritative contribution guidelines**, including
testing, documentation, and dependency expectations, are maintained in the
[Contribution Guide](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution_guide.html).
