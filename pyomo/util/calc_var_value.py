    """Calculate the variable value given a specified equality constraint

    This function calculates the value of the specified variable
    necessary to make the provided equality constraint feasible
    (assuming any other variables values are fixed).  The method first
    attempts to solve for the variable value assuming it appears
    linearly in the constraint.  If that doesn't converge the constraint
    residual, it falls back on Newton's method using exact (symbolic)
    derivatives.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    variable: `pyomo.core.base.var._VarData`
        The variable to solve for
    constraint: `pyomo.core.base.constraint._ConstraintData`
        The equality constraint to use to solve for the variable value
    eps: `float`
        The tolerance to use to determine equality [default=1e-8].
    iterlim: `int`
        The maximum number of iterations if this method has to fall back
        on using Newton's method.  Raises RuntimeError on iteration
        limit [default=1000]
    linesearch: `bool`
        Decides whether or not to use the linesearch (recommended).
        [default=True]
    alpha_min: `float`
        The minimum fractional step to use in the linesearch [default=1e-8].

    Returns:
    --------
    None

    Note: this is an unconstrained solver and is NOT guaranteed to
    respect the variable bounds.
