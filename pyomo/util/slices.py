    The call stack is a `list` of `tuple`s where the first entry is a

    as `IndexedComponent_slice`. The second entry is the argument of
    the corresponding function. Following this sequence of calls from
    `context` (or the top-level model if `context is None`) will

    context : `pyomo.core.base.block.Block`
