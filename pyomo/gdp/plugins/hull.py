    """Relax disjunctive model by forming the hull reformulation.

    Relaxes a disjunctive model into an algebraic model by forming the
    hull reformulation of each disjunction.

    This transformation accepts the following keyword arguments:

    Parameters
    ----------
    perspective_function : str
        The perspective function used for the disaggregated variables.
        Must be one of 'FurmanSawayaGrossmann' (default),
        'LeeGrossmann', or 'GrossmannLee'
    EPS : float
        The value to use for epsilon [default: 1e-4]
    targets : (block, disjunction, or list of those types)
        The targets to transform. This can be a block, disjunction, or a
        list of blocks and Disjunctions [default: the instance]

    The transformation will create a new Block with a unique
    name beginning "_pyomo_gdp_hull_reformulation".
    The block will have a dictionary "_disaggregatedVarMap:
        'srcVar': ComponentMap(<src var>:<disaggregated var>),
        'disaggregatedVar': ComponentMap(<disaggregated var>:<src var>)

    It will also have a ComponentMap "_bigMConstraintMap":

        <disaggregated var>:<bounds constraint>

    Last, it will contain an indexed Block named "relaxedDisjuncts",
    which will hold the relaxed disjuncts.  This block is indexed by
    an integer indicating the order in which the disjuncts were relaxed.
    Each block has a dictionary "_constraintMap":

        'srcConstraints': ComponentMap(<transformed constraint>:
                                       <src constraint>),
        'transformedConstraints':
            ComponentMap(<src constraint container> :
                         <transformed constraint container>,
                         <src constraintData> : [<transformed constraintDatas>])

    All transformed Disjuncts will have a pointer to the block their transformed
    constraints are on, and all transformed Disjunctions will have a
    pointer to the corresponding OR or XOR constraint.

    The _pyomo_gdp_hull_reformulation block will have a ComponentMap
    "_disaggregationConstraintMap":
        <src var>:ComponentMap(<srcDisjunction>: <disaggregation constraint>)

            h_ik(x) <= 0

        with

            x_k = sum( nu_ik )
            y_ik * h_ik( nu_ik/y_ik ) <= 0

        "GrossmannLee" is an updated formulation from Grossmann &
        Lee (2003) [2]_, which avoids divide-by-0 errors by using:

            x_k = sum( nu_ik )
            (y_ik + eps) * h_ik( nu_ik/(y_ik + eps) ) <= 0

        "FurmanSawayaGrossmann" (default) is an improved relaxation [3]_
        that is exact at 0 and 1 while avoiding numerical issues from
        the Lee & Grossmann formulation by using:

            x_k = sum( nu_ik )
            ((1-eps)*y_ik + eps) * h_ik( nu_ik/((1-eps)*y_ik + eps) ) \
                - eps * h_ki(0) * ( 1-y_ik ) <= 0
