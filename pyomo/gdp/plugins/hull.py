    Relaxes a disjunctive model into an algebraic model by forming the

    This transformation accepts the following keyword arguments:

    Parameters
    ----------
    perspective_function : str
        The perspective function used for the disaggregated variables.
        Must be one of 'FurmanSawayaGrossmann' (default),
        'LeeGrossmann', or 'GrossmannLee'
    EPS : float
        The value to use for epsilon [default: 1e-4]
    targets : (block, disjunction, or list of those types)
        The targets to transform. This can be a block, disjunction, or a
        list of blocks and Disjunctions [default: the instance]

    The transformation will create a new Block with a unique
    name beginning "_pyomo_gdp_hull_reformulation". It will contain an
    indexed Block named "relaxedDisjuncts" that will hold the relaxed
    disjuncts.  This block is indexed by an integer indicating the order
    in which the disjuncts were relaxed. Each block has a dictionary
    "_constraintMap":

        'srcConstraints': ComponentMap(<transformed constraint>:
                                       <src constraint>),
        'transformedConstraints':
            ComponentMap(<src constraint container> :
                         <transformed constraint container>,
                         <src constraintData> : [<transformed constraintDatas>])

    All transformed Disjuncts will have a pointer to the block their transformed
    constraints are on, and all transformed Disjunctions will have a
    pointer to the corresponding OR or XOR constraint.

    The _pyomo_gdp_hull_reformulation block will have a ComponentMap
    "_disaggregationConstraintMap":
        <src var>:ComponentMap(<srcDisjunction>: <disaggregation constraint>)

        The perspective function used for variable disaggregation

        with

            x_k = sum( nu_ik )
            y_ik * h_ik( nu_ik/y_ik ) <= 0

        "GrossmannLee" is an updated formulation from Grossmann &
        Lee (2003) [2]_, which avoids divide-by-0 errors by using:

            x_k = sum( nu_ik )
            (y_ik + eps) * h_ik( nu_ik/(y_ik + eps) ) <= 0

        "FurmanSawayaGrossmann" (default) is an improved relaxation [3]_
        that is exact at 0 and 1 while avoiding numerical issues from
        the Lee & Grossmann formulation by using:

            x_k = sum( nu_ik )
            ((1-eps)*y_ik + eps) * h_ik( nu_ik/((1-eps)*y_ik + eps) ) \
