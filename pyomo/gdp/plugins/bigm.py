class BigM_Transformation(Transformation):
    """Relax disjunctive model using big-M terms.

    Relaxes a disjunctive model into an algebraic model by adding Big-M
    terms to all disjunctive constraints.

    This transformation accepts the following keyword arguments:
        bigM: A user-specified value (or dict) of M values to use (see below)
        targets: the targets to transform [default: the instance]

    M values are determined as follows:
       1) if the constraint appears in the bigM argument dict
       2) if the constraint parent_component appears in the bigM
          argument dict
       3) if any block which is an ancestor to the constraint appears in
          the bigM argument dict
       3) if 'None' is in the bigM argument dict
       4) if the constraint or the constraint parent_component appear in
          a BigM Suffix attached to any parent_block() beginning with the
          constraint's parent_block and moving up to the root model.
       5) if None appears in a BigM Suffix attached to any
          parent_block() between the constraint and the root model.
       6) if the constraint is linear, estimate M using the variable bounds

    M values may be a single value or a 2-tuple specifying the M for the
    lower bound and the upper bound of the constraint body.

    Specifying "bigM=N" is automatically mapped to "bigM={None: N}".

    The transformation will create a new Block with a unique
    name beginning "_pyomo_gdp_bigm_reformulation".  That Block will
    contain an indexed Block named "relaxedDisjuncts", which will hold
    the relaxed disjuncts.  This block is indexed by an integer
    indicating the order in which the disjuncts were relaxed.
    Each block has a dictionary "_constraintMap":

        'srcConstraints': ComponentMap(<transformed constraint>:
                                       <src constraint>)
        'transformedConstraints': ComponentMap(<src constraint>:
                                               <transformed constraint>)

    All transformed Disjuncts will have a pointer to the block their transformed
    constraints are on, and all transformed Disjunctions will have a
    pointer to the corresponding 'Or' or 'ExactlyOne' constraint.

        This is only relevant when the transformation will be estimating values
        for M. If True, the transformation will calculate M values assuming that
        fixed variables will always be fixed to their current values. This means
        that if a fixed variable is unfixed after transformation, the
        transformed model is potentially no longer valid. By default, the
        transformation will assume fixed variables could be unfixed in the
        future and will use their bounds to calculate the M value rather than
        their value. Note that this could make for a weaker LP relaxation
        while the variables remain fixed.

        constraint was specified. (In particular, this can be used to
        verify which BigM Suffixes were actually necessary to the
        transformation.)

        Return is of the form: ((lower_M_val, lower_M_source, lower_M_key),

        the first (second) element will be (None, None, None). Note that if
        a constraint is of the form a <= expr <= b or is an equality constraint,
        it is not necessarily true that the source of lower_M and upper_M
        are the same.

        If the M value came from an arg, source is the  dictionary itself and
        key is the key in that dictionary which gave us the M value.

        If the M value came from a Suffix, source is the BigM suffix used and
        key is the key in that Suffix.

        If the transformation calculated the value, both source and key are
        None.
