    separable constraints are split into separate constraints by introducing
    auxiliary variables that upperbound the subexpressions created by the split.
    Increasing the number of partitions can result in tighter hull relaxations,

    The transformation will create a new Block with a unique name beginning

    The Block will have new Disjunct objects, each corresponding to one of the
