        Flag indicating whether or not to handle disjunctive
        constraints that bound a single variable in a single
        constraint, rather than one per Disjunct.

        Given the not-uncommon special structure:

        [l_1 <= x <= u_1] v [l_2 <= x <= u_2] v ... v [l_K <= x <= u_K],

        instead of applying the rote transformation that would create 2*K
        different constraints in the relaxation, we can write two constraints:

        x >= l_1*y_1 + l_2*y_2 + ... + l_K*y_k
        x <= u_1*y_1 + u_2*y_2 + ... + u_K*y_K.

        This relaxation is as tight and has fewer constraints. This option is
        a flag to tell the mbigm transformation to detect this structure and
        handle it specially. Note that this is a special case of the 'Hybrid
        Big-M Formulation' from [Vie15]_ that takes advantage of the common left-
        hand side matrix for disjunctive constraints that bound a single
        variable.

        Note that we do not use user-specified M values for these constraints
        when this flag is set to True: If tighter bounds exist then they
        they should be put in the constraints.

        Sometimes it is only computationally advantageous to apply multiple-
        bigm to disjunctive constraints with the special structure:

        [l_1 <= x <= u_1] v [l_2 <= x <= u_2] v ... v [l_K <= x <= u_K],

        and transform other disjunctive constraints with the traditional
        big-M transformation. This flag is used to set the above behavior.
