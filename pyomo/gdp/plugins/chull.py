    """Relax disjunctive model by forming the convex hull.

    Relaxes a disjunctive model into an algebraic model by forming the
    convex hull of each disjunction.

    This transformation accepts the following keyword arguments:

    Parameters
    ----------
    perspective_function : str
        The perspective function used for the disaggregated variables.
        Must be one of 'FurmanSawayaGrossmann' (default),
        'LeeGrossmann', or 'GrossmannLee'
    EPS : float
        The value to use for epsilon [default: 1e-4]
    targets : (block, disjunction, ComponentUID or list of those types)
        The targets to transform. This can be a block, disjunction, or a
        list of blocks and Disjunctions [default: the instance]

    After transformation, every transformed disjunct will have a
    "_gdp_transformation_info" dict containing 2 entries:

        'relaxed': True,
        'chull': {
            'relaxationBlock': <block>,
            'relaxedConstraints': ComponentMap(constraint: relaxed_constraint)
            'disaggregatedVars': ComponentMap(var: list of disaggregated vars),
            'bigmConstraints': ComponentMap(disaggregated var: bigM constraint),
        }

    In addition, any block or disjunct containing a relaxed disjunction
    will have a "_gdp_transformation_info" dict with the following
    entry:

        'disjunction_or_constraint': <constraint>

    Finally, the transformation will create a new Block with a unique
    name beginning "_pyomo_gdp_chull_relaxation".  That Block will
    contain an indexed Block named "relaxedDisjuncts", which will hold
    the relaxed disjuncts.  This block is indexed by an integer
    indicating the order in which the disjuncts were relaxed.  Each
    block will have a "_gdp_transformation_info" dict with the following
    entries:

        'src': <source disjunct>
        'srcVars': ComponentMap(disaggregated var: original var),
        'srcConstraints': ComponentMap(relaxed_constraint: constraint)
        'boundConstraintToSrcVar': ComponentMap(bigm_constraint: orig_var),

        The perspective function used for variable disaggregation

        "LeeGrossmann" is the original NL convex hull from Lee &
        Grossmann (2000) [1]_, which substitutes nonlinear constraints

            h_ik(x) <= 0

        with

            x_k = sum( nu_ik )
            y_ik * h_ik( nu_ik/y_ik ) <= 0

        "GrossmannLee" is an updated formulation from Grossmann &
        Lee (2003) [2]_, which avoids divide-by-0 errors by using:

            x_k = sum( nu_ik )
            (y_ik + eps) * h_ik( nu_ik/(y_ik + eps) ) <= 0

        "FurmanSawayaGrossmann" (default) is an improved relaxation [3]_
        that is exact at 0 and 1 while avoiding numerical issues from
        the Lee & Grossmann formulation by using:

            x_k = sum( nu_ik )
            ((1-eps)*y_ik + eps) * h_ik( nu_ik/((1-eps)*y_ik + eps) ) \
