    tighten_relaxation : callback to modify the GDP model before the hull

    create_cuts : callback to create cuts using the solved relaxed bigM and hull
                  problems
    post_process_cut : callback to perform post-processing on created cuts
    back_off_problem_tolerance : tolerance to use while post-processing
    zero_tolerance : Tolerance at which a float will be considered 0 when
                     using Fourier-Motzkin elimination to create cuts.
    do_integer_arithmetic : Whether or not to require Fourier-Motzkin elimination
                            to do integer arithmetic. Only possible when all
                            data is integer.
    tight_constraint_tolerance : Tolerance at which a constraint is considered
                                 tight for the Fourier-Motzkin cut generation
                                 procedure

    By default, the callbacks will be set such that the algorithm performed is
    as presented in [1], but with an additional post-processing procedure to
    reduce numerical error, which calculates the maximum violation of the cut 
    subject to the relaxed hull constraints, and then pads the constraint by 
    this violation plus an additional user-specified tolerance.

    In addition, the create_cuts_fme function provides an (exponential time)
    method of generating cuts which reduces numerical error (and can eliminate 
    it if all data is integer). It collects the hull constraints which are 
    tight at the solution of the separation problem. It creates a cut in the 
    extended space perpendicular to  a composite normal vector created by 
    summing the directions normal to these constraints. It then performs 
    fourier-motzkin elimination on the collection of constraints and the cut
    to project out the disaggregated variables. The resulting constraint which
    is most violated by the relaxed bigM solution is then returned.
