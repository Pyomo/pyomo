    Cloning is roughly equivalent to calling ``copy.deepcopy``.

    tree.   Note that named expression objects are treated as
    leaves when :attr:`clone_leaves` is :const:`True`, and hence
    those subexpressions are not cloned.

    This function uses a non-recursive
    logic, which makes it more scalable than the logic in
    ``copy.deepcopy``.

    Args:
        expr: The expression that will be cloned.
        substitute (dict): A dictionary mapping object ids to
