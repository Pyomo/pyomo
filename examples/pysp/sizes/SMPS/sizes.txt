Sizes

SMPS format, two-stage mixed integer problem.

The files sizes.sto, sizes.cor, and sizes.tim contain the SMPS format
description of the 10 scenario problem given in

A. L{\o}kketangen and D. L. Woodruff,
"Progressive Hedging and Tabu Search Applied to Mixed Integer (0,1) Multistage Stochastic Programming",
Journal of Heuristics, 1996, Vol 2, Pages 111-128.

Operations Research Letters, 1999, Vol 24, Pages 37-45.)

The file sizes.mps contains a deterministic equivalent for the
problem. The solution is 224706 (with a gap of less than 1%).

The problem was created by a taking a real-world deterministic
production planning problem and adding "artificial" stochastics.
