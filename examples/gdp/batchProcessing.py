'''Problem from http://www.minlp.org/library/problem/index.php?i=172&lib=GDP
We are minimizing the cost of a design of a plant with parallel processing units and storage tanks
in between. We decide the number and volume of units, and the volume and location of the storage
tanks. The problem is convexified and has a nonlinear objective and global constraints

NOTE: When I refer to 'gams' in the comments, that is Batch101006_BM.gms for now. It's confusing
because the _opt file is different (It has hard-coded bigM parameters so that each constraint 
has the "optimal" bigM).'''
