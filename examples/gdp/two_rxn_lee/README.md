# Two reactor synthesis problem

This is a simple choice between two reactor units, described in the paper:

Ruiz, Juan P; Grossmann, Ignacio E. "Strengthening of lower bounds in the
global optimization of Bilinear and Concave Generalized Disjunctive Programs."
Computers and Chemical Engineering. 34(6): 914-930. DOI:
10.1016/j.compchemeng.2009.10.016

The example appears in section 5.1 on page 920.

The problem involves selection between two reactors, which have a certain
linear flow-conversion relationship within separate conversion regimes. A
bilinear maximum demand constraint exists on the product of flow and
conversion.

The example was originally based on an example from Lee and Grossmann, 2003.
