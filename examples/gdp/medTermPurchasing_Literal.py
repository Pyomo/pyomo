# Medium-term Purchasing Contracts problem from http://minlp.org/library/lib.php?lib=GDP
# This model maximizes profit in a short-term horizon in which various contracts
# are available for purchasing raw materials. The model decides inventory levels,
# amounts to purchase, amount sold, and flows through the process nodes while
# maximizing profit. The four different contracts available are:
# FIXED PRICE CONTRACT: buy as much as you want at constant price
# DISCOUNT CONTRACT: quantities below minimum amount cost RegPrice. Any additional quantity
# above min amount costs DiscoutPrice.
# BULK CONTRACT: If more than min amount is purchased, whole purchase is at discount price.
# FIXED DURATION CONTRACT: Depending on length of time contract is valid, there is a purchase
# price during that time and min quantity that must be purchased


# This version of the model is a literal transcription of what is in
# ShortTermContractCH.gms from the website. Some data is hardcoded into this model,
# most notably the process structure itself and the mass balance information.
