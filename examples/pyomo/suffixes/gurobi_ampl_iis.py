# A Suffix example for the gurobi_ampl solver.
#
# This Pyomo example is formulated as a python script.
# To run this script execute the following command:
#
# $ pyomo_python gurobi_ampl_iis.py
#
# Execution of this script requires that the gurobi_ampl
# solver is in the current search path for executables
# on this system. This example was tested using Gurobi
# Solver 5.0.0

### Create the gurobi_ampl solver plugin using the ASL interface

# Create an IMPORT Suffix to store the iis information that will
# be returned by gurobi_ampl

### Send the model to gurobi_ampl and collect the solution
# The solver plugin will scan the model for all active suffixes
# valid for importing, which it will store into the results object
