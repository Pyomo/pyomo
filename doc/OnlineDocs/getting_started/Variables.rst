Variables
=========

Variables are intended to ultimately be given values by an optimization package. They are
declared and optionally bounded, given initial values, and documented using the Pyomo ``Var`` function. If index sets are given as arguments to this function
they are used to index the variable. Other optional directives include:

* bounds = A function (or Python object) that gives a (lower,upper) bound pair for the variable
* domain = A set that is a super-set of the values the variable can take on.
* initialize = A function (or Python object) that gives a starting value for the variable; this is particularly important for non-linear models
* within = (synonym for ``domain``)

The following code snippet illustrates some aspects of these options by declaring a *singleton* (i.e. unindexed) variable named ``model.LumberJack``
that will take on real values between zero and 6 and it initialized to be 1.5:

.. literalinclude:: spyfiles/spy4Variables_Declare_singleton_variable.spy
   :language: python

Instead of the ``initialize`` option, initialization is sometimes done with a Python assignment statement
as in

.. literalinclude:: spyfiles/spy4Variables_Assign_value.spy
   :language: python

For indexed variables, bounds and initial values are often specified by a rule (a Python function) that
itself may make reference to parameters or other data. The formal arguments to these rules begins
with the model followed by the indexes. This is illustrated in the following code snippet that
makes use of Python dictionaries declared as lb and ub that are used by a function
to provide bounds:

.. literalinclude:: spyfiles/spy4Variables_Declare_bounds.spy
   :language: python

NOTE: Many of the pre-defined virtual sets that are used as domains imply bounds. A strong
example is the set ``Boolean`` that implies bounds of zero and one.
