Objectives
==========

An objective is a function of variables that returns a value that an optimization package attempts to maximize or minimize. The ``Objective`` function in Pyomo declares
an objective. Although other mechanisms are possible, this function is typically
passed the name of another function that gives the expression.
Here is a very simple version of such a function that assumes ``model.x`` has
previously been declared as a ``Var``:

.. literalinclude:: spyfiles/spy4Objectives_Objective_function_expression.spy
   :language: python


It is more common for an objective function to refer to parameters as in this example
that assumes that ``model.p`` has been declared as a parameters and that ``model.x`` has been declared with
the same index set, while ``model.y`` has been declared as a singleton:

.. literalinclude:: spyfiles/spy4Objectives_Objective_refer_parameters.spy
   :language: python

This example uses the ``sense`` option to specify maximization. The default sense is
``minimize``.
