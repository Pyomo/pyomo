``BuildAction`` and ``BuildCheck``
==================================

This is a somewhat advanced topic. In some cases, it is desirable to trigger actions
to be done as part of the model building process. The ``BuildAction`` function provides
this capability in a Pyomo model.
It takes as arguments optional index sets and a function to peform the action.
For example,

.. literalinclude:: spyfiles/abstract2piecebuild_BuildAction_example.spy
   :language: python

calls the function ``bpts_build`` for each member of ``model.J``. The function
``bpts_build`` should have the model and a variable for the members of ``model.J`` as
formal arguments. In this example, the following would be a valid
declaration for the function:

.. literalinclude:: spyfiles/abstract2piecebuild_Function_valid_declaration.spy
   :language: python


A full example, which extends the :ref:`abstract2.py` and
:ref:`abstract2piece.py` examples, is

.. literalinclude:: spyfiles/abstract2piecebuild.spy
   :language: python

This example uses the build action to create a model component with breakpoints for a
:ref:`piecewise` function.  The ``BuildAction`` is triggered by the assignment to
``model.BuildBpts``. This object is not referenced again, the only goal is to
cause the execution of ``bpts_build,`` which places data in the ``model.bpts`` dictionary.
Note that if ``model.bpts`` had been a ``Set``, then it could have been created with an
``initialize`` argument to the ``Set`` declaration. Since it is a special-purpose
dictionary to support the :ref:`piecewise` functionality in Pyomo, we use a ``BuildAction``.

Another application of ``BuildAction`` can be intialization of Pyomo model data from
Python data structures, or efficient initialization of Pyomo model data from
other Pyomo model data. Consider the :ref:`Isinglecomm.py` example. Rather than
using an initialization for each list of sets ``NodesIn`` and ``NodesOut`` separately
using ``initialize``, it is a little more efficient and probably a little clearer, to
use a build action.

The full model is:

.. literalinclude:: examples/Isinglebuild.py
   :language: python

for this model, the same data file can be used as for Isinglecomm.py in :ref:`Isinglecomm.py` such as the toy data file:

.. literalinclude:: examples/Isinglecomm.dat

Build actions can also be a way to implement data validation,
particularly when multiple Sets or Parameters must be
analyzed. However, the the ``BuildCheck`` component is prefered for this
purpose. It executes its rule just like a ``BuildAction`` but will
terminate the construction of the model instance if the rule returns
``False``.
