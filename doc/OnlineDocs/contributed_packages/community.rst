Community Detection for Pyomo models
====================================

This package separates model components (variables, constraints, and objectives) into different communities
distinguished by the degree of connectivity between community members.

Description of Package and ``detect_communities`` function
----------------------------------------------------------
The community detection package allows users to obtain a community map of a Pyomo model - a Python dictionary-like
object that maps sequential integer values to communities within the Pyomo model. The package
takes in a model, organizes the model components into a graph of nodes and edges, then uses Louvain
community detection (`Blondel et al, 2008`_) to determine the communities that exist within the model.

.. _Blondel et al, 2008: https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-5468/2008/10/P10008

In graph theory, a community is defined as a subset of nodes that have a greater degree of connectivity within
themselves than they do with the rest of the nodes in the graph. In the context of Pyomo models, a community
represents a subproblem within the overall optimization problem. Identifying these subproblems and then solving them
independently can save computational work compared with trying to solve the entire model at once. Thus, it
can be very useful to know the communities that exist in a model.

The manner in which the graph of nodes and edges is constructed from the model directly affects the community
detection. Thus, this package provides the user with a lot of control over the construction of the graph. The
function we use for this community detection is shown below:

.. autofunction:: pyomo.contrib.community_detection.detection.detect_communities
  :noindex:

As stated above, the characteristics of the NetworkX graph of the Pyomo model are very important to the
community detection. The main graph features the user can specify are the type of community map,
whether the graph is weighted or unweighted, and whether the objective function(s) is included
in the graph generation. Below, the significance and reasoning behind including each of these options are
explained in greater depth.

Type of Community Map (`type_of_community_map`)
    In this package's main function (``detect_communities``), the user can select ``'bipartite'``, ``'constraint'``,
    or ``'variable'`` as an input for the 'type_of_community_map' argument, and these result in a community map
    based on a bipartite graph, a constraint node graph, or a variable node graph (respectively).

    If the user sets ``type_of_community_map='constraint'``, then each entry in the community map (which is a dictionary) contains
    a list of all the constraints in the community as well as all the variables contained in those constraints.
    For the model graph, a node is created for every active constraint in the model, an edge between two
    constraint nodes is created only if those two constraint equations share a variable, and the
    weight of each edge is equal to the number of variables the two constraint equations have in common.

    If the user sets ``type_of_community_map='variable'``, then each entry in the community map (which is a dictionary) contains
    a list of all the variables in the community as well as all the constraints that contain those variables.
    For the model graph, a node is created for every variable in the model, an edge between two variable nodes is
    created only if those two variables occur in the same constraint equation, and the weight of each edge is equal
    to the number of constraint equations in which the two variables occur together.

    If the user sets ``type_of_community_map='bipartite'``, then each entry in the community map (which is a dictionary) is
    simply all of the nodes in the community but split into a list of constraints and a list of variables.
    For the model graph, a node is created for every variable and every constraint in the model. An edge is created
    between a constraint node and a variable node only if the constraint equation contains the variable. (Edges are
    not drawn between nodes of the same type in a bipartite graph.) And as for the edge weights, the edges in the
    bipartite graph are unweighted regardless of what the user specifies for the ``weighted_graph`` parameter. (This is
    because for our purposes, the number of times a variable appears in a constraint is not particularly
    useful.)

Weighted Graph/Unweighted Graph (`weighted_graph`)
    The Louvain community detection algorithm takes edge weights into account, so depending on whether the graph is
    weighted or unweighted, the communities that are found will vary. This can be valuable depending on how
    the user intends to use the community detection information. For example, if a user plans on feeding that
    information into an algorithm, the algorithm may be better suited to the communities detected in a weighted
    graph (or vice versa).

With/Without Objective in the Graph (`with_objective`)
    This argument determines whether the objective function(s) will be included when creating the graphical
    representation of the model and thus whether the objective function(s) will be included in the community map.
    Some models have an objective function that contains so many of the model variables that it obscures potential
    communities within a model. Thus, it can be useful to call ``detect_communities(model, with_objective=False)``
    on such a model to see whether isolating the other components of the model provides any new insights.

External Packages
-----------------
* NetworkX
* Python-Louvain

The community detection package relies on two external packages, the NetworkX package and the Louvain community
detection package. Both of these packages can be installed at the following URLs (respectively):

https://pypi.org/project/networkx/

https://pypi.org/project/python-louvain/

The pip install and conda install commands are included below as well::

    pip install networkx
    pip install python-louvain

    conda install -c anaconda networkx
    conda install -c conda-forge python-louvain

Usage Examples
--------------

Let's start off by taking a look at how we can use ``detect_communities`` to create a CommunityMap object.
We'll first use a model from `Allman et al, 2019`_ :

.. _Allman et al, 2019: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11081-019-09450-5

.. doctest::
    :skipif: not networkx_available

    Required Imports
    >>> from pyomo.contrib.community_detection.detection import detect_communities, CommunityMap, generate_model_graph
    >>> from pyomo.contrib.mindtpy.tests.eight_process_problem import EightProcessFlowsheet
    >>> from pyomo.core import ConcreteModel, Var, Constraint
    >>> import networkx as nx

    Let's define a model for our use
    >>> def decode_model_1():
    ...     model = m = ConcreteModel()
    ...     m.x1 = Var(initialize=-3)
    ...     m.x2 = Var(initialize=-1)
    ...     m.x3 = Var(initialize=-3)
    ...     m.x4 = Var(initialize=-1)
    ...     m.c1 = Constraint(expr=m.x1 + m.x2 <= 0)
    ...     m.c2 = Constraint(expr=m.x1 - 3 * m.x2 <= 0)
    ...     m.c3 = Constraint(expr=m.x2 + m.x3 + 4 * m.x4 ** 2 == 0)
    ...     m.c4 = Constraint(expr=m.x3 + m.x4 <= 0)
    ...     m.c5 = Constraint(expr=m.x3 ** 2 + m.x4 ** 2 - 10 == 0)
    ...     return model
    >>> model = m = decode_model_1()
    >>> seed = 5  # To be used as a random seed value for the heuristic Louvain community detection

    Let's create an instance of the CommunityMap class (which is what gets returned by the
    function detect_communities):
    >>> community_map_object = detect_communities(model, type_of_community_map='bipartite', random_seed=seed)

This community map object has many attributes that contain the relevant information about the
community map itself (such as the parameters used to create it, the networkX representation, and other useful
information).

An important point to note is that the community_map attribute of the CommunityMap class is the
actual dictionary that maps integers to the communities within the model. It is expected that the user will be
most interested in the actual dictionary itself, so dict-like usage is permitted.

If a user wishes to modify the actual dictionary (the community_map attribute of the CommunityMap object),
creating a deep copy is highly recommended (or else any destructive modifications could
have unintended consequences): ``new_community_map = copy.deepcopy(community_map_object.community_map)``

Let's take a closer look at the actual community map object generated by `detect_communities`:

.. doctest::
    :skipif: not networkx_available
    :hide:

    >>> from pyomo.common.formatting import tostr
    >>> if tostr(community_map_object[0]) == "([c3, c4, c5], [x3, x4])":
    ...    _ = community_map_object.community_map
    ...    _[0], _[1] = _[1], _[0]

.. doctest::
    :skipif: not networkx_available

    >>> print(community_map_object)
    {0: (['c1', 'c2'], ['x1', 'x2']), 1: (['c3', 'c4', 'c5'], ['x3', 'x4'])}



Printing a community map object is made to be user-friendly (by showing the community map with components
replaced by their strings). However, if the default Pyomo representation of components is desired, then the
community_map attribute or the `repr()` function can be used:

.. doctest::
    :skipif: not networkx_available

    >>> print(community_map_object.community_map)
    {0: ([<pyomo.core.base.constraint.ScalarConstraint object at ...>, <pyomo.core.base.constraint.ScalarConstraint object at ...>], [<pyomo.core.base.var.ScalarVar object at ...>, <pyomo.core.base.var.ScalarVar object at ...>]), 1: ([<pyomo.core.base.constraint.ScalarConstraint object at ...>, <pyomo.core.base.constraint.ScalarConstraint object at ...>, <pyomo.core.base.constraint.ScalarConstraint object at ...>], [<pyomo.core.base.var.ScalarVar object at ...>, <pyomo.core.base.var.ScalarVar object at ...>])}
    >>> print(repr(community_map_object))
    {0: ([<pyomo.core.base.constraint.ScalarConstraint object at ...>, <pyomo.core.base.constraint.ScalarConstraint object at ...>], [<pyomo.core.base.var.ScalarVar object at ...>, <pyomo.core.base.var.ScalarVar object at ...>]), 1: ([<pyomo.core.base.constraint.ScalarConstraint object at ...>, <pyomo.core.base.constraint.ScalarConstraint object at ...>, <pyomo.core.base.constraint.ScalarConstraint object at ...>], [<pyomo.core.base.var.ScalarVar object at ...>, <pyomo.core.base.var.ScalarVar object at ...>])}

`generate_structured_model` method of CommunityMap objects
    It may be useful to create a new model based on the communities found in the model - we can use the
    ``generate_structured_model`` method of the CommunityMap class to do this. Calling this method on a CommunityMap object
    returns a new model made up of blocks that correspond to each of the communities found in the original model. Let's
    take a look at the example below:

    .. doctest::
        :skipif: not networkx_available

        Use the CommunityMap object made from the first code example
        >>> structured_model = community_map_object.generate_structured_model()  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> structured_model.pprint()  # doctest: +SKIP

        5 Declarations: b_index b x2 equality_constraint_list_index equality_constraint_list

    We see that there is an equality constraint list (`equality_constraint_list`) that has been created. This is due to
    the fact that the ``detect_communities`` function can return a community map that has Pyomo components (variables,
    constraints, or objectives) in more than one community, and thus, an equality_constraint_list is created to ensure that
    the new model still corresponds to the original model. This is explained in more detail below.

    Consider the case where community detection is done on a constraint node graph - this would result in communities
    that are made up of the corresponding constraints as well as all the variables that occur in the given constraints.
    Thus, it is possible for certain Pyomo components to be in multiple communities (and a similar argument exists
    for community detection done on a variable node graph). As a result, our structured model (the model returned by
    the ``generate_structured_model`` method) may need to have several "copies" of a certain component. For example,
    a variable `original_model.x1` that exists in the original model may have corresponding forms
    `structured_model.b[0].x1`, `structured_model.b[0].x1`, `structured_model.x1`. In order for these components to
    meaningfully correspond to their counterparts in the original model, they must be bounded by equality constraints.
    Thus, we use an `equality_constraint_list` to bind different forms of a component from the original model.

    The last point to make about this method is that variables will be created outside of blocks if (1) an objective
    is not inside a block (for example if the community detection is done `with_objective=False`) or if (2) an
    objective/constraint contains a variable that is not in the same block as the given objective/constraint.

`visualize_model_graph` method of CommunityMap objects
    If we want a visualization of the communities within the Pyomo model, we can use ``visualize_model_graph`` to do
    so. Let's take a look at how this can be done in the following example:

    .. doctest::
        :skipif: not matplotlib_available or not networkx_available

        Create a CommunityMap object (so we can demonstrate the visualize_model_graph method)
        >>> community_map_object = cmo = detect_communities(model, type_of_community_map='bipartite', random_seed=seed)

        Generate a matplotlib figure (left_figure) - a constraint graph of the community map
        >>> left_figure, _ = cmo.visualize_model_graph(type_of_graph='constraint')

        Now, we will generate the figure on the right (a bipartite graph of the community map)
        >>> right_figure, _ = cmo.visualize_model_graph(type_of_graph='bipartite')

An example of the two separate graphs created for these two function calls is shown below:
    .. image:: communities_decode_1.png
      :width: 100%
      :alt: Graphical representation of the communities in the model 'decode_model_1' for two different types of graphs

    These graph drawings very clearly demonstrate the communities within this model. The constraint graph (which is colored
    using the bipartite community map) shows a very simple illustration - one node for each constraint, with only one edge
    connecting the two communities (which represents the variable `m.x2` common to `m.c2` and `m.c3` in separate
    communities)
    The bipartite graph is slightly more complicated and we can see again how there is only one edge between the two
    communities and more edges within each community. This is an ideal situation for breaking a
    model into separate communities since there is little connectivity between the communities. Also, note that we can
    choose different graph types (such as a variable node graph, constraint node graph, or bipartite graph) for a given
    community map.

    Let's try a more complicated model (taken from `Duran & Grossmann, 1986`_) - this example will demonstrate how the same
    graph can be illustrated using different community maps (in the previous example we illustrated different graphs with a
    single community map):

    .. _Duran & Grossmann, 1986: https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02592064

    .. doctest::
        :skipif: not matplotlib_available or not networkx_available

        Define the model
        >>> model = EightProcessFlowsheet()

        Now, we follow steps similar to the example above (see above for explanations)
        >>> community_map_object = cmo = detect_communities(model, type_of_community_map='constraint', random_seed=seed)
        >>> left_fig, pos = cmo.visualize_model_graph(type_of_graph='variable')

        As we did before, we will use the returned 'pos' to create a consistent graph layout
        >>> community_map_object = cmo = detect_communities(model, type_of_community_map='bipartite')
        >>> middle_fig, _ = cmo.visualize_model_graph(type_of_graph='variable', pos=pos)

        >>> community_map_object = cmo = detect_communities(model, type_of_community_map='variable')
        >>> right_fig, _ = cmo.visualize_model_graph(type_of_graph='variable', pos=pos)

We can see an example for the three separate graphs created by these three function calls below:
    .. image:: communities_8pp.png
       :width: 100%
       :alt: Graphical representation of the communities in the model 'decode_model_1' for slightly different function calls

    The three graphs above are all variable graphs - which means the nodes represent variables in the model, and the edges
    represent constraint equations. The coloring differs because the three graphs rely on community maps that were
    created based on a constraint node graph, a bipartite graph, and a variable node graph (from left to right). For
    example, the community map that was generated from a constraint node graph (``type_of_community_map='constraint'``)
    resulted in three communities (as seen by the purple, yellow, and blue nodes).

`generate_model_graph` function
    Now, we will take a look at ``generate_model_graph`` - this function can be used to create a NetworkX
    graph for a Pyomo model (and is used in `detect_communities`). Here, we will create a NetworkX graph from
    the model in our first example and then create the edge and adjacency list for the graph.

    ``generate_model_graph`` returns three things:

    * a NetworkX graph of the given model
    * a dictionary that maps the numbers used to represent the model components to
      the actual components (because Pyomo components cannot be directly added to a NetworkX graph)
    * a dictionary that maps constraints to the variables in them.

    For this example, we will only need the NetworkX graph of the model and the number-to-component mapping.

    .. doctest::
        :skipif: not networkx_available

        Define the model
        >>> model = decode_model_1()

        See above for the description of the items returned by 'generate_model_graph'
        >>> model_graph, number_component_map, constr_var_map = generate_model_graph(model, type_of_graph='constraint')

        The next two lines create and implement a mapping to change the node values from numbers into
        strings. The second line uses this mapping to create string_model_graph, which has
        the relabeled nodes (strings instead of numbers).

        >>> string_map = dict((number, str(comp)) for number, comp in number_component_map.items())
        >>> string_model_graph = nx.relabel_nodes(model_graph, string_map)

        Now, we print the edge list and the adjacency list:
        Edge List:
        >>> for line in nx.generate_edgelist(string_model_graph): print(line)  # doctest: +SKIP
        c1 c2 {'weight': 2}
        c1 c3 {'weight': 1}
        c2 c3 {'weight': 1}
        c3 c5 {'weight': 2}
        c3 c4 {'weight': 2}
        c4 c5 {'weight': 2}

        Adjacency List:
        >>> print(list(nx.generate_adjlist(string_model_graph)))  # doctest: +SKIP
        ['c1 c2 c3', 'c2 c3', 'c3 c5 c4', 'c4 c5', 'c5']

    It's worth mentioning that in the code above, we do not have to create ``string_map`` to create an edge list
    or adjacency list, but for the sake of having an easily understandable output, it is quite helpful. (Without
    relabeling the nodes, the output below would not have the strings of the components but instead would have
    integer values.) This code will hopefully make it easier for a user to do the same.
