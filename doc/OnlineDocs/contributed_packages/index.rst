Third-Party Contributions
=========================

Pyomo includes a variety of additional features and functionality
provided by third parties through the ``pyomo.contrib`` package.  This
package includes both contributions included with the main Pyomo
distribution and wrappers for third-party packages that must be
installed separately.

These packages are maintained by the original contributors and are
managed as *optional* Pyomo packages.

Contributed packages distributed with Pyomo:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   
   community.rst

   mindtpy.rst
   multistart.rst
   preprocessing.rst

Contributed Pyomo interfaces to other packages:

Contributed packages distributed independently of Pyomo, but accessible
through ``pyomo.contrib``:
