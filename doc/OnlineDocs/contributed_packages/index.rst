Third-Party Contributions
=========================

Pyomo includes a variety of additional features and functionality
provided by third parties through the ``pyomo.contrib`` package.  This
package includes both contributions included with the main Pyomo
distribution and wrappers for third-party packages that must be
installed separately.

These packages are maintained by the original contributors and are
managed as *optional* Pyomo packages.

Contributed packages distributed with Pyomo:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   preprocessing.rst
   gdpopt.rst
   multistart.rst
   parmest/index.rst

Contributed packages distributed independently of Pyomo, but accessible
through ``pyomo.contrib``:

* `pyomo.contrib.simplemodel <http://pyomocontrib-simplemodel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source.html>`_
