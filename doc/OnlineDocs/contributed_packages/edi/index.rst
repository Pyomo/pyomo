Engineering Design Interface (EDI)
==================================

The Pyomo Engineering Design Interface (EDI) is a lightweight wrapper on the Pyomo language that is targeted at composing engineering design optimization problems.  The language and interface have been designed to mimic many of the features found in `GPkit <https://github.com/convexengineering/gpkit>`_ and `CVXPY <https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy>`_ while also providing a simple, clean interface for black-box analysis codes that are common in engineering design applications.


Installation
------------

EDI installs as a part of the standard pyomo install:

::

    pip install pyomo


EDI also requires packages that are optional in base pyomo:

::

    pip install numpy
    pip install scipy
    pip install pint
