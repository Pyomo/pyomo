Pyomo is a Python-based open-source software package that supports a
diverse set of optimization capabilities for formulating, solving, and
analyzing optimization models.

A core capability of Pyomo is modeling structured optimization
applications.  Pyomo can be used to define general symbolic problems,
create specific problem instances, and solve these instances using
commercial and open-source solvers.
