Third-Party Contributions
=========================

Pyomo includes a variety of additional features and functionality
provided by third parties through the ``pyomo.contrib`` package.  This
package includes both contributions included with the main Pyomo
distribution and wrappers for third-party packages that must be
installed separately.

These packages are maintained by the original contributors and are
managed as *optional* Pyomo packages.
