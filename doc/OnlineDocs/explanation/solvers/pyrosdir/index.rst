PyROS Solver 
============

PyROS (Pyomo Robust Optimization Solver) is a Pyomo-based meta-solver
for non-convex, two-stage adjustable robust optimization problems.

It was developed by **Natalie M. Isenberg**, **Jason A. F. Sherman**,
and **Chrysanthos E. Gounaris** of Carnegie Mellon University,
in collaboration with **John D. Siirola** of Sandia National Labs.
The developers gratefully acknowledge support from the U.S. Department of Energy's
`Institute for the Design of Advanced Energy Systems (IDAES) <https://idaes.org>`_.
