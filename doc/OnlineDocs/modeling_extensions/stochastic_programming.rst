Stochastic Programming in Pyomo
===============================

There are two extensions for modeling and solving Stochastic Programs in
Pyomo.  Both are currently distributed as independent Python packages.
PySP was the original extension (and up through Pyomo 5.7.3 was
distributed as part of Pyomo).  You can find the documentation here:

    `https://pysp.readthedocs.io <https://pysp.readthedocs.io>`_

In 2020, the PySP developers released the mpi-sppy package, which
reimplemented much of the functionality from PySP in a new scalable
framework built on top of MPI and the mpi4py package.  Future
development of stochastic programming capabilities is occurring in
mpi-sppy.  The documentation is available here:
