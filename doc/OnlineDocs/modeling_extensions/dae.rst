===================================

   :align: right

The pyomo.DAE modeling extension allows users to incorporate systems of
differential algebraic equations (DAE)s in a Pyomo model. The modeling
components in this extension are able to represent ordinary or partial
differential equations. The differential equations do not have to be
written in a particular format and the components are flexible enough to
represent higher-order derivatives or mixed partial
derivatives. Pyomo.DAE also includes model transformations which use
simultaneous discretization approaches to transform a DAE model into an
algebraic model. Finally, pyomo.DAE includes utilities for simulating
DAE models and initializing dynamic optimization problems.



Modeling Components
-------------------

.. (Replace these definitions with in-code documentation)

Pyomo.DAE introduces three new modeling components to Pyomo:

.. autosummary::
   :nosignatures:

   pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet
   pyomo.dae.DerivativeVar
   pyomo.dae.Integral

As will be shown later, differential equations can be declared using
using these new modeling components along with the standard Pyomo
:py:class:`Var <pyomo.environ.Var>` and
:py:class:`Constraint <pyomo.environ.Constraint>` components.

ContinuousSet
*************

This component is used to define continuous bounded domains (for example
'spatial' or 'time' domains). It is similar to a Pyomo
:py:class:`Set <pyomo.environ.Set>`  component and can be used to index things
like variables and constraints. Any number of
:py:class:`ContinuousSets <pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` can be used to index a
component and components can be indexed by both
:py:class:`Sets <pyomo.environ.Set>` and
:py:class:`ContinuousSets <pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` in arbitrary order.

In the current implementation, models with
:py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` components may not be solved
until every :py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` has been
discretized. Minimally, a :py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>`
must be initialized with two numeric values representing the upper and lower
bounds of the continuous domain. A user may also specify additional points in
the domain to be used as finite element points in the discretization.

.. autoclass:: pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet
    :members:

The following code snippet shows examples of declaring a
:py:class:`ContinuousSet <pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` component on a
concrete Pyomo model:

.. doctest::

   Required imports
   >>> from pyomo.environ import *
   >>> from pyomo.dae import *

   >>> model = ConcreteModel()

   Declaration by providing bounds
   >>> model.t = ContinuousSet(bounds=(0,5))

   Declaration by initializing with desired discretization points
   >>> model.x = ContinuousSet(initialize=[0,1,2,5])

.. note::
   A :py:class:`ContinuousSet <pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` may not be
   constructed unless at least two numeric points are provided to bound the
   continuous domain.

The following code snippet shows an example of declaring a
:py:class:`ContinuousSet <pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` component on an
abstract Pyomo model using the example data file.

.. code-block:: ampl

   set t := 0 0.5 2.25 3.75 5;

.. doctest::

   Required imports
   >>> from pyomo.environ import *
   >>> from pyomo.dae import *

   >>> model = AbstractModel()

   The ContinuousSet below will be initialized using the points
   in the data file when a model instance is created.
   >>> model.t = ContinuousSet()

.. note:: 
   If a separate data file is used to initialize a
   :py:class:`ContinuousSet <pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>`, it is done using
   the 'set' command and not 'continuousset'

.. note::
   Most valid ways to declare and initialize a
   :py:class:`Set <pyomo.environ.Set>` can be used to
   declare and initialize a :py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>`.
   See the documentation for :py:class:`Set <pyomo.environ.Set>` for additional
   options.

.. warning:: 
   Be careful using a :py:class:`ContinuousSet
   <pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` as an implicit index in an expression,
   i.e. ``sum(m.v[i] for i in m.myContinuousSet)``. The expression will
   be generated using the discretization points contained in the
   :py:class:`ContinuousSet <pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` at the time the
   expression was constructed and will not be updated if additional
   points are added to the set during discretization.

.. note::
   :py:class:`ContinuousSet <pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` components are
   always ordered (sorted) therefore the ``first()`` and ``last()``
   :py:class:`Set <pyomo.environ.Set>` methods can be used to access the lower
   and upper boundaries of the
   :py:class:`ContinuousSet <pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` respectively
 
DerivativeVar
*************

.. autoclass:: pyomo.dae.DerivativeVar
    :members:

The code snippet below shows examples of declaring
:py:class:`DerivativeVar <pyomo.dae.DerivativeVar>` components on a
Pyomo model. In each case, the variable being differentiated is supplied
as the only positional argument and the type of derivative is specified
using the 'wrt' (or the more verbose 'withrespectto') keyword
argument. Any keyword argument that is valid for a Pyomo
:py:class:`Var <pyomo.environ.Var>` component may also be specified.

.. doctest::

   Required imports
   >>> from pyomo.environ import *
   >>> from pyomo.dae import *

   >>> model = ConcreteModel()
   >>> model.s = Set(initialize=['a','b'])
   >>> model.t = ContinuousSet(bounds=(0,5))
   >>> model.l = ContinuousSet(bounds=(-10,10))

   >>> model.x = Var(model.t)
   >>> model.y = Var(model.s,model.t)
   >>> model.z = Var(model.t,model.l)

   Declare the first derivative of model.x with respect to model.t
   >>> model.dxdt = DerivativeVar(model.x, withrespectto=model.t)

   Declare the second derivative of model.y with respect to model.t
   Note that this DerivativeVar will be indexed by both model.s and model.t
   >>> model.dydt2 = DerivativeVar(model.y, wrt=(model.t,model.t))

   Declare the partial derivative of model.z with respect to model.l
   Note that this DerivativeVar will be indexed by both model.t and model.l
   >>> model.dzdl = DerivativeVar(model.z, wrt=(model.l), initialize=0)

   Declare the mixed second order partial derivative of model.z with respect
   to model.t and model.l and set bounds
   >>> model.dz2 = DerivativeVar(model.z, wrt=(model.t, model.l), bounds=(-10, 10))

.. note:: 
   The 'initialize' keyword argument will initialize the value of a
   derivative and is **not** the same as specifying an initial
   condition. Initial or boundary conditions should be specified using a
   :py:class:`Constraint<pyomo.environ.Constraint>` or
   :py:class:`ConstraintList<pyomo.environ.ConstraintList>` or
   by fixing the value of a :py:class:`Var<pyomo.environ.Var>` at a boundary
   point.

Declaring Differential Equations
--------------------------------

A differential equations is declared as a standard Pyomo
:py:class:`Constraint<pyomo.environ.Constraint>` and is not required to have
any particular form. The following code snippet shows how one might declare
an ordinary or partial differential equation.

.. doctest::

   Required imports
   >>> from pyomo.environ import *
   >>> from pyomo.dae import *

   >>> model = ConcreteModel()
   >>> model.s = Set(initialize=['a', 'b'])
   >>> model.t = ContinuousSet(bounds=(0, 5))
   >>> model.l = ContinuousSet(bounds=(-10, 10))

   >>> model.x = Var(model.s, model.t)
   >>> model.y = Var(model.t, model.l)
   >>> model.dxdt = DerivativeVar(model.x, wrt=model.t)
   >>> model.dydt = DerivativeVar(model.y, wrt=model.t)
   >>> model.dydl2 = DerivativeVar(model.y, wrt=(model.l, model.l))

   An ordinary differential equation
   >>> def _ode_rule(m, s, t):
   ...    if t == 0:
   ...       return Constraint.Skip
   ...    return m.dxdt[s, t] == m.x[s, t]**2
   >>> model.ode = Constraint(model.s, model.t, rule=_ode_rule)

   A partial differential equation
   >>> def _pde_rule(m, t, l):
   ...    if t == 0 or l == m.l.first() or l == m.l.last():
   ...       return Constraint.Skip
   ...    return m.dydt[t, l] == m.dydl2[t, l]
   >>> model.pde = Constraint(model.t, model.l, rule=_pde_rule)

By default, a :py:class:`Constraint<pyomo.environ.Constraint>` declared over a
:py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` will be applied at every
discretization point contained in the set. Often a modeler does not want to
enforce a differential equation at one or both boundaries of a continuous
domain. This may be addressed explicitly in the
:py:class:`Constraint<pyomo.environ.Constraint>` declaration using
``Constraint.Skip`` as shown above. Alternatively, the desired constraints can
be deactivated just before the model is sent to a solver as shown below.

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> model.del_component('ode_index')
    >>> model.del_component('pde_index')
    >>> model.del_component('ode')
    >>> model.del_component('pde')

.. doctest::

   >>> def _ode_rule(m, s, t):
   ...    return m.dxdt[s, t] == m.x[s, t]**2
   >>> model.ode = Constraint(model.s, model.t, rule=_ode_rule)

   >>> def _pde_rule(m, t, l):
   ...    return m.dydt[t, l] == m.dydl2[t, l]
   >>> model.pde = Constraint(model.t, model.l, rule=_pde_rule)

   Declare other model components and apply a discretization transformation
   ...

   Deactivate the differential equations at certain boundary points
   >>> for con in model.ode[:, model.t.first()]:
   ...    con.deactivate()

   >>> for con in model.pde[0, :]:
   ...    con.deactivate()

   >>> for con in model.pde[:, model.l.first()]:
   ...    con.deactivate()

   >>> for con in model.pde[:, model.l.last()]:
   ...   con.deactivate()

   Solve the model
   ...

.. note::
   If you intend to use the pyomo.DAE
   :py:class:`Simulator<pyomo.dae.Simulator>` on your model then you
   **must** use **constraint deactivation** instead of **constraint
   skipping** in the differential equation rule.

Declaring Integrals
-------------------

.. warning::
   The :py:class:`Integral<pyomo.dae.Integral>` component is still under
   development and considered a prototype. It currently includes only basic
   functionality for simple integrals. We welcome feedback on the interface
   and functionality but **we do not recommend using it** on general
   models. Instead, integrals should be reformulated as differential
   equations.

.. autoclass:: pyomo.dae.Integral
   :members:

Declaring an :py:class:`Integral<pyomo.dae.Integral>` component is similar to
declaring an :py:class:`Expression<pyomo.environ.Expression>` component. A
simple example is shown below:

.. doctest::

   >>> model = ConcreteModel()
   >>> model.time = ContinuousSet(bounds=(0,10))
   >>> model.X = Var(model.time)
   >>> model.scale = Param(initialize=1E-3)

   >>> def _intX(m,t):
   ...    return m.X[t]
   >>> model.intX = Integral(model.time,wrt=model.time,rule=_intX)

   >>> def _obj(m):
   ...    return m.scale*m.intX
   >>> model.obj = Objective(rule=_obj)

Notice that the positional arguments supplied to the
:py:class:`Integral<pyomo.dae.Integral>` declaration must include all indices
needed to evaluate the integral expression. The integral expression is defined
in a function and supplied to the 'rule' keyword argument. Finally, a user must
specify a :py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` that the integral
is being evaluated over. This is done using the 'wrt' keyword argument.

.. note:: 
   The :py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` specified using the
   'wrt' keyword argument must be explicitly specified as one of the indexing
   sets (meaning it must be supplied as a positional argument). This is to
   ensure consistency in the ordering and dimension of the indexing sets

After an :py:class:`Integral<pyomo.dae.Integral>` has been declared, it can be
used just like a Pyomo :py:class:`Expression<pyomo.environ.Expression>`
component and can be included in constraints or the objective function as shown
above.

If an :py:class:`Integral<pyomo.dae.Integral>` is specified with multiple
positional arguments, i.e. multiple indexing sets, the final component will be
indexed by all of those sets except for the
:py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` that the integral was
taken over. In other words, the
:py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` specified with the
'wrt' keyword argument is removed from the indexing sets of the
:py:class:`Integral<pyomo.dae.Integral>` even though it must be specified as a
positional argument. This should become more clear with the following example
showing a double integral over the
:py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` components ``model.t1`` and
``model.t2``. In addition, the expression is also indexed by the
:py:class:`Set<pyomo.environ.Set>` ``model.s``. The mathematical representation
and implementation in Pyomo are shown below:

.. math::
    \sum_{s} \int_{t_2} \int_{t_1} \! X(t_1, t_2, s) \, dt_1 \, dt_2

.. doctest::

    >>> model = ConcreteModel()
    >>> model.t1 = ContinuousSet(bounds=(0, 10))
    >>> model.t2 = ContinuousSet(bounds=(-1, 1))
    >>> model.s = Set(initialize=['A', 'B', 'C'])

    >>> model.X = Var(model.t1, model.t2, model.s)

    >>> def _intX1(m, t1, t2, s):
    ...    return m.X[t1, t2, s]
    >>> model.intX1 = Integral(model.t1, model.t2, model.s, wrt=model.t1,
    ...                        rule=_intX1)

    >>> def _intX2(m, t2, s):
    ...    return m.intX1[t2, s]
    >>> model.intX2 = Integral(model.t2, model.s, wrt=model.t2, rule=_intX2)

    >>> def _obj(m):
    ...    return sum(m.intX2[k] for k in m.s)
    >>> model.obj = Objective(rule=_obj)

Discretization Transformations
------------------------------

Before a Pyomo model with :py:class:`DerivativeVar<pyomo.dae.DerivativeVar>`
or :py:class:`Integral<pyomo.dae.Integral>` components can be sent to a
solver it must first be sent through a discretization transformation. These
transformations approximate any derivatives or integrals in the model by
using a numerical method. The numerical methods currently included in pyomo.DAE
discretize the continuous domains in the problem and introduce equality
constraints which approximate the derivatives and integrals at the
discretization points. Two families of discretization schemes have been
implemented in pyomo.DAE, Finite Difference and Collocation. These schemes are
described in more detail below.

.. note:: 
    The schemes described here are for derivatives only. All integrals will
    be transformed using the trapezoid rule.

The user must write a Python script in order to use these discretizations,
they have not been tested on the pyomo command line. Example scripts are
shown below for each of the discretization schemes. The transformations are
applied to Pyomo model objects which can be further manipulated before being
sent to a solver. Examples of this are also shown below.

Finite Difference Transformation
********************************

This transformation includes implementations of several finite
difference methods. For example, the Backward Difference method (also
called Implicit or Backward Euler) has been implemented. The
discretization equations for this method are shown below:

.. math::
    \begin{array}{l}
    \mathrm{Given: } \\
    \frac{dx}{dt} = f(t, x) , \quad x(t_0) = x_{0} \\
    \text{discretize $t$ and $x$ such that } \\
    x(t_0 + kh) = x_{k} \\
    x_{k + 1} = x_{k} + h * f(t_{k + 1}, x_{k + 1}) \\
    t_{k + 1} = t_{k} + h
    \end{array}

where :math:`h` is the step size between discretization points or the size of
each finite element. These equations are generated automatically as
:py:class:`Constraints<pyomo.environ.Constraint>` when the backward
difference method is applied to a Pyomo model.

There are several discretization options available to a
``dae.finite_difference`` transformation which can be specified as keyword
arguments to the ``.apply_to()`` function of the transformation object. These
keywords are summarized below:

.. Replace with in-code documentation. The autoclass that works with the
.. plugins: pyomo.dae.plugins.finitedifference.Finite_Difference_Transformation


Keyword arguments for applying a finite difference transformation:

'nfe'
    The desired number of finite element points to be included in the
    discretization. The default value is 10.

'wrt'
    Indicates which :py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` the
    transformation should be applied to. If this keyword argument is not
    specified then the same scheme will be applied to every
    :py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` .

'scheme'
    Indicates which finite difference method to apply. Options are
    'BACKWARD', 'CENTRAL', or 'FORWARD'. The default scheme is the backward
    difference method.

If the existing number of finite element points in a
:py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` is less than the desired
number, new discretization points will be added to the set. If a user specifies
a number of finite element points which is less than the number of points
already included in the :py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` then
the transformation will ignore the specified number and proceed with the larger
set of points. Discretization points will never be removed from a
:py:class:`ContinousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` during the discretization.

The following code is a Python script applying the backward difference
method. The code also shows how to add a constraint to a discretized model.

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> model = ConcreteModel()
    >>> model.time = ContinuousSet(bounds=(0, 10))
    >>> model.x1 = Var(model.time, bounds=(-10, 10))
    >>> model.dx1 = DerivativeVar(model.x1)

.. doctest::

    Discretize model using Backward Difference method
    >>> discretizer = TransformationFactory('dae.finite_difference')
    >>> discretizer.apply_to(model,nfe=20,wrt=model.time,scheme='BACKWARD')

    Add another constraint to discretized model
    >>> def _sum_limit(m):
    ...    return sum(m.x1[i] for i in m.time) <= 50
    >>> model.con_sum_limit = Constraint(rule=_sum_limit)

    Solve discretized model
    >>> solver = SolverFactory('ipopt')
    >>> results = solver.solve(model)

Collocation Transformation
**************************

This transformation uses orthogonal collocation to discretize the
differential equations in the model. Currently, two types of collocation
have been implemented. They both use Lagrange polynomials with either
Gauss-Radau roots or Gauss-Legendre roots. For more information on
orthogonal collocation and the discretization equations associated with this
method please see chapter 10 of the book "Nonlinear Programming: Concepts,
Algorithms, and Applications to Chemical Processes" by L.T. Biegler.

The discretization options available to a ``dae.collocation`` transformation
are the same as those described above for the finite difference transformation
with different available schemes and the addition of the 'ncp' option.

.. Replace with in-code documentation. The autoclass that works with the
.. plugins: pyomo.dae.plugins.finitedifference.Finite_Difference_Transformation

Additional keyword arguments for collocation discretizations:

'scheme'
    The desired collocation scheme, either 'LAGRANGE-RADAU' or
    'LAGRANGE-LEGENDRE'. The default is 'LAGRANGE-RADAU'.

'ncp'
    The number of collocation points within each finite element. The
    default value is 3.

.. note::
    If the user's version of Python has access to the package Numpy then any
    number of collocation points may be specified, otherwise the maximum number
    is 10.

.. note::
    Any points that exist in a
    :py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` before discretization
    will be used as finite element boundaries and not as collocation points.
    The locations of the collocation points cannot be specified by the user,
    they must be generated by the transformation.

The following code is a Python script applying collocation with Lagrange
polynomials and Radau roots. The code also shows how to add an objective
function to a discretized model.

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> model = ConcreteModel()
    >>> model.time = ContinuousSet(bounds=(0, 10))
    >>> model.x = Var(model.time, bounds=(-10, 10))
    >>> model.dx = DerivativeVar(model.x)
    >>> model.x_ref = Param(initialize=5)

.. doctest::

    Discretize model using Radau Collocation
    >>> discretizer = TransformationFactory('dae.collocation')
    >>> discretizer.apply_to(model,nfe=20,ncp=6,scheme='LAGRANGE-RADAU')

    Add objective function after model has been discretized
    >>> def obj_rule(m):
    ...    return sum((m.x[i]-m.x_ref)**2 for i in m.time)
    >>> model.obj = Objective(rule=obj_rule)

    Solve discretized model
    >>> solver = SolverFactory('ipopt')
    >>> results = solver.solve(model)

Restricting Optimal Control Profiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When solving an optimal control problem a user may want to restrict the
number of degrees of freedom for the control input by forcing, for example,
a piecewise constant profile. Pyomo.DAE provides the
``reduce_collocation_points`` function to address this use-case. This function
is used in conjunction with the ``dae.collocation`` discretization
transformation to reduce the number of free collocation points within a finite
element for a particular variable.

.. autoclass:: pyomo.dae.plugins.colloc.Collocation_Discretization_Transformation
    :members: reduce_collocation_points

An example of using this function is shown below:

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> model = ConcreteModel()
    >>> model.time = ContinuousSet(bounds=(0, 10))
    >>> model.x = Var(model.time, bounds=(-10, 10))
    >>> model.dx = DerivativeVar(model.x)
    >>> model.x_ref = Param(initialize=5)
    >>> model.u = Var(model.time)

.. doctest::

    >>> discretizer = TransformationFactory('dae.collocation')
    >>> discretizer.apply_to(model, nfe=10, ncp=6)
    >>> model = discretizer.reduce_collocation_points(model,
    ...                                               var=model.u,
    ...                                               ncp=1,
    ...                                               contset=model.time)

In the above example, the ``reduce_collocation_points`` function restricts
the variable ``model.u`` to have only **1** free collocation point per
finite element, thereby enforcing a piecewise constant profile.
:numref:`Fig. %s <reduce_points_fig>` shows the solution profile before and
after appling
the ``reduce_collocation_points`` function.

Applying Multiple Discretization Transformations
************************************************

Discretizations can be applied independently to each
:py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` in a model. This allows the
user great flexibility in discretizing their model. For example the same
numerical method can be applied with different resolutions:

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> model = ConcreteModel()
    >>> model.t1 = ContinuousSet(bounds=(0, 10))
    >>> model.t2 = ContinuousSet(bounds=(-2, 2))

.. doctest::

    >>> discretizer = TransformationFactory('dae.finite_difference')
    >>> discretizer.apply_to(model,wrt=model.t1,nfe=10)
    >>> discretizer.apply_to(model,wrt=model.t2,nfe=100)

This also allows the user to combine different methods. For example, applying
the forward difference method to one
:py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` and the central finite
difference method to another
:py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>`:

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> model = ConcreteModel()
    >>> model.t1 = ContinuousSet(bounds=(0, 10))
    >>> model.t2 = ContinuousSet(bounds=(-2, 2))

.. doctest::

    >>> discretizer = TransformationFactory('dae.finite_difference')
    >>> discretizer.apply_to(model,wrt=model.t1,scheme='FORWARD')
    >>> discretizer.apply_to(model,wrt=model.t2,scheme='CENTRAL')

In addition, the user may combine finite difference and collocation
discretizations. For example:

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> model = ConcreteModel()
    >>> model.t1 = ContinuousSet(bounds=(0, 10))
    >>> model.t2 = ContinuousSet(bounds=(-2, 2))

.. doctest::

    >>> disc_fe = TransformationFactory('dae.finite_difference')
    >>> disc_fe.apply_to(model,wrt=model.t1,nfe=10)
    >>> disc_col = TransformationFactory('dae.collocation')
    >>> disc_col.apply_to(model,wrt=model.t2,nfe=10,ncp=5)

If the user would like to apply the same discretization to all
:py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>` components in a model, just
specify the discretization once without the 'wrt' keyword argument. This will
apply that scheme to all :py:class:`ContinuousSet<pyomo.dae.ContinuousSet>`
components in the model that haven't already been discretized.

Custom Discretization Schemes
*****************************

A transformation framework along with certain utility functions has been
created so that advanced users may easily implement custom discretization
schemes other than those listed above. The transformation framework consists of
the following steps:

    1. Specify Discretization Options
    2. Discretize the ContinuousSet(s)
    3. Update Model Components
    4. Add Discretization Equations
    5. Return Discretized Model

If a user would like to create a custom finite difference scheme then they only
have to worry about step (4) in the framework. The discretization equations for
a particular scheme have been isolated from of the rest of the code for
implementing the transformation. The function containing these discretization
equations can be found at the top of the source code file for the
transformation. For example, below is the function for the forward
difference method:

.. code-block:: python

    def _forward_transform(v,s):
    """
    Applies the Forward Difference formula of order O(h) for first derivatives
    """
        def _fwd_fun(i):
            tmp = sorted(s)
            idx = tmp.index(i)
            return 1/(tmp[idx+1]-tmp[idx])*(v(tmp[idx+1])-v(tmp[idx]))
        return _fwd_fun

In this function, 'v' represents the continuous variable or function that the
method is being applied to. 's' represents the set of discrete points in the
continuous domain. In order to implement a custom finite difference method, a
user would have to copy the above function and just replace the equation next
to the first return statement with their method.

After implementing a custom finite difference method using the above function
template, the only other change that must be made is to add the custom method
to the 'all_schemes' dictionary in the ``dae.finite_difference``
class.

In the case of a custom collocation method, changes will have to be made in
steps (2) and (4) of the transformation framework. In addition to implementing
the discretization equations, the user would also have to ensure that the
desired collocation points are added to the ContinuousSet being discretized.

Dynamic Model Simulation
------------------------

The pyomo.dae Simulator class can be used to simulate systems of ODEs and
DAEs. It provides an interface to integrators available in other Python
packages.

.. note::
    The pyomo.dae Simulator does not include integrators directly. The user
    must have at least one of the supported Python packages installed in
    order to use this class.

.. autoclass:: pyomo.dae.Simulator
    :members:

.. note::
    Any keyword options supported by the integrator may be specified as
    keyword options to the simulate function and will be passed to the
    integrator.

The Simulator currently includes interfaces to SciPy and CasADi. ODE
simulation is supported in both packages however, DAE simulation is only
supported by CasADi. A list of available integrators for each package is
given below. Please refer to the `SciPy

and `CasADi
<http://casadi.sourceforge.net/api/html/db/d3d/classcasadi_1_1Integrator.html>`_ documentation directly for the most up-to-date information about
these packages and for more information about the various integrators and
options.

Using the Simulator
*******************

We now show how to use the Simulator to simulate the following system of ODEs:

.. math::
    \begin{array}{l}
    \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \omega \\
    \frac{d\omega}{dt} = -b*\omega -c*sin(\theta)
    \end{array}

We begin by formulating the model using pyomo.DAE

.. doctest::

    >>> m = ConcreteModel()

    >>> m.t = ContinuousSet(bounds=(0.0, 10.0))

    >>> m.b = Param(initialize=0.25)
    >>> m.c = Param(initialize=5.0)

    >>> m.omega = Var(m.t)
    >>> m.theta = Var(m.t)

    >>> m.domegadt = DerivativeVar(m.omega, wrt=m.t)
    >>> m.dthetadt = DerivativeVar(m.theta, wrt=m.t)

    Setting the initial conditions
    >>> m.omega[0].fix(0.0)
    >>> m.theta[0].fix(3.14 - 0.1)

    >>> def _diffeq1(m, t):
    ...     return m.domegadt[t] == -m.b * m.omega[t] - m.c * sin(m.theta[t])
    >>> m.diffeq1 = Constraint(m.t, rule=_diffeq1)

    >>> def _diffeq2(m, t):
    ...     return m.dthetadt[t] == m.omega[t]
    >>> m.diffeq2 = Constraint(m.t, rule=_diffeq2)

Notice that the initial conditions are set by `fixing` the values of
``m.omega`` and ``m.theta`` at t=0 instead of being specified as extra
equality constraints. Also notice that the differential equations are
specified without using ``Constraint.Skip`` to skip enforcement at t=0. The
Simulator cannot simulate any constraints that contain if-statements in
their construction rules.

To simulate the model you must first create a Simulator object. Building
this object prepares the Pyomo model for simulation with a particular Python
package and performs several checks on the model to ensure compatibility
with the Simulator. Be sure to read through the list of limitations at the
end of this section to understand the types of models supported by the
Simulator.

.. doctest::

    >>> sim = Simulator(m, package='scipy') # doctest: +SKIP

After creating a Simulator object, the model can be simulated by calling the
simulate function. Please see the API documentation for the
:py:class:`Simulator<pyomo.dae.Simulator>` for more information about the
valid keyword arguments for this function.

.. doctest::

    >>> tsim, profiles = sim.simulate(numpoints=100, integrator='vode') # doctest: +SKIP

The ``simulate`` function returns numpy arrays containing time points and
the corresponding values for the dynamic variable profiles.

`Simulator Limitations`:
    - Differential equations must be first-order and separable
    - Model can only contain a single ContinuousSet
    - Can't simulate constraints with if-statements in the construction rules
    - Need to provide initial conditions for dynamic states by setting the
      value or using fix()

Specifying Time-Varing Inputs
*****************************
The :py:class:`Simulator<pyomo.dae.Simulator>` supports simulation of a system
of ODE's or DAE's with time-varying parameters or control inputs. Time-varying
inputs can be specified using a Pyomo ``Suffix``. We currently only support
piecewise constant profiles. For more complex inputs defined by a continuous
function of time we recommend adding an algebraic variable and constraint to
your model.

The profile for a time-varying input should be specified
using a Python dictionary where the keys correspond to the switching times
and the values correspond to the value of the input at a time point. A
``Suffix`` is then used to associate this dictionary with the appropriate
``Var`` or ``Param`` and pass the information to the
:py:class:`Simulator<pyomo.dae.Simulator>`. The code snippet below shows an
example.

.. doctest::

    >>> m = ConcreteModel()

    >>> m.t = ContinuousSet(bounds=(0.0, 20.0))

    Time-varying inputs
    >>> m.b = Var(m.t)
    >>> m.c = Param(m.t, default=5.0)

    >>> m.omega = Var(m.t)
    >>> m.theta = Var(m.t)

    >>> m.domegadt = DerivativeVar(m.omega, wrt=m.t)
    >>> m.dthetadt = DerivativeVar(m.theta, wrt=m.t)

    Setting the initial conditions
    >>> m.omega[0] = 0.0
    >>> m.theta[0] = 3.14 - 0.1

    >>> def _diffeq1(m, t):
    ...    return m.domegadt[t] == -m.b[t] * m.omega[t] - \
    ...                             m.c[t] * sin(m.theta[t])
    >>> m.diffeq1 = Constraint(m.t, rule=_diffeq1)

    >>> def _diffeq2(m, t):
    ...    return m.dthetadt[t] == m.omega[t]
    >>> m.diffeq2 = Constraint(m.t, rule=_diffeq2)

    Specifying the piecewise constant inputs
    >>> b_profile = {0: 0.25, 15: 0.025}
    >>> c_profile = {0: 5.0, 7: 50}

    Declaring a Pyomo Suffix to pass the time-varying inputs to the Simulator
    >>> m.var_input = Suffix(direction=Suffix.LOCAL)
    >>> m.var_input[m.b] = b_profile
    >>> m.var_input[m.c] = c_profile

    Simulate the model using scipy
    >>> sim = Simulator(m, package='scipy') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> tsim, profiles = sim.simulate(numpoints=100,
    ...                               integrator='vode',
    ...                               varying_inputs=m.var_input) # doctest: +SKIP

.. note::
    The Simulator does not support multi-indexed inputs (i.e. if ``m.b`` in
    the above example was indexed by another set besides ``m.t``)

Dynamic Model Initialization
----------------------------
Providing a good initial guess is an important factor in solving dynamic
optimization problems. There are several model initialization tools under
development in pyomo.DAE to help users initialize their models. These tools
will be documented here as they become available.

From Simulation
***************
The :py:class:`Simulator<pyomo.dae.Simulator>` includes a function for
initializing discretized dynamic optimization models using the profiles
returned from the simulator. An example using this function is shown below

.. doctest::
    :pyversion: > 2.6

    Simulate the model using scipy
    >>> sim = Simulator(m, package='scipy') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> tsim, profiles = sim.simulate(numpoints=100, integrator='vode',
    ...                               varying_inputs=m.var_input) # doctest: +SKIP

    Discretize model using Orthogonal Collocation
    >>> discretizer = TransformationFactory('dae.collocation')
    >>> discretizer.apply_to(m, nfe=10, ncp=3)

    Initialize the discretized model using the simulator profiles
    >>> sim.initialize_model() # doctest: +SKIP

.. note::
    A model must be simulated before it can be initialized using this function
