## Pyomo Overview

Pyomo is a Python-based open-source software package that supports a diverse set of optimization capabilities for formulating and analyzing optimization models. Modeling optimization applications is a core capability of Pyomo.  Pyomo can be used to define symbolic problems, create concrete problem instances, and solve these instances with standard solvers.  Thus, Pyomo provides a capability that is commonly associated with algebraic modeling languages such as AMPL, AIMMS, and GAMS, but Pyomo's modeling objects are embedded within a full-featured high-level programming language with a rich set of supporting libraries.  Pyomo supports a wide range of problem types, including:

 -  Linear programming
 -  Quadratic programming
 -  Nonlinear programming
 -  Mixed-integer linear programming
 -  Mixed-integer quadratic programming
 -  Mixed-integer nonlinear programming
 -  Mixed-integer stochastic programming
 -  Generalized disjunctive programming
 -  Differential algebraic equations
 -  Bilevel programming
 -  Mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints
