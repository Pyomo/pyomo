- pyomo.solver
  - Resolved serious issues with python direct interfaces:
    - CPLEX: constants in linear range constraints and all quadratic
      constraints were being excluded from the expression.
    - CPLEX and GUROBI: actually raise an exception when a nonlinear
      (non-quadratic) objective or constraint expression is encountered
      rather than just emitting the linear and quadratic part of the
      expression to the solver. This could lead to a naive user
      thinking they have solved a general nonlinear model with these
      solvers.
    - CPLEX and GUROBI: do not skip trivial constraints by default.
      Adding I/O option 'skip_trivial_constraints' to recover this
      behavior.
    - CPLEX: Merging as much of CPLEXPersistent with CPLEXDirect
      as possible to avoid repeating bug fixes. More should be done,
      but for now CPLEXDirect is a base class for CPLEXPersistent.

    float('inf') and float('-inf') are treated the same as variable
    bounds set to None.
  - Updates to Pyro solver managers
    - Major performance enhancements for Pyro-based solver managers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pyomo 1.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- OPT

  - Reorganized pyomo.opt to rely on plugins for most of its core
    functionality.

  - Changed the default output for PICO to be LP format, rather than
    .NL. This avoids issues with name-mapping that we haven't resolved yet.

  - Updated LP writer to not output integer/binary status for variables
    that aren't referenced in the model.

  - In LP output format, modified constraint names to be "suffixed"
    with the index in the same fashion as variables. The suffix is "None"
    if the constraint is a singleton. Will help debug models during
    development/prototyping.

  - For MIPs, added "slack" suffix to solutions and modified CPLEX solver
    interface to populate the suffix accordingly.

  - Improvement of the factory mechanism used to launch optimizers;
    solvers can be passed options during construction.

  - The CPLEX LP format assumes default variable bounds equal to 0 and
    +inf. These conflict with the more sane defaults in Pyomo, which are
    -inf and +inf. This leads to all kinds of silent, incorrect behavior
    in terms of getting very strange solutions where you are expecting a
    straightforward solve. The cpxlp writer was changed to always output
    bounds for variables, which is the safest route in any case.

  - Added a facility for managing asynchronous events. In particular,
    this facility has been setup to support the application of Pyomo
    solvers with subclasses of the AsynchronousSolverManager.

  - Created a distributed solver manager that uses the Pyro
    RPC package.

  - Rework of MIP solver interfaces for CPLEX, GLPK, PICO and CBC.

  - Using an explicit temporary file when launching the shell command
    subprocess, to avoid a buffer overflow.

  - A rework of the logic in shellcmd.py to segregate the solution
    into preprocess/solve/postprocess. This facilitates a fine-grain
    parallelization of just the IP solve, using Pyro.

  - If a variable name has the format x(1,a) or x[3,4,5] then create a
    dictionary attribute 'x' in the SolverResults object, which maps the
    tuple values to the corresponding value.

    For example:

      results.solution().variable.add('x(1,a)')
      print results.solution().variable.x[1,'a']

  - A change in the converter semantics. Now, the convert returns a
    tuple of filenames. In most cases, this is a singleton tuple. But
    in some important cases this is a non-singleton tuple (e.g. AMPL
    *.mod/*.dat files).


- PYOMO

  - Reworked Pyomo's management of components to use plugins.

  - Adding two new components BuildCheck and BuildAction. Their
    usage is similar, but their expected use is a it
    different. BuildAction  allows for the injection of arbitrary build
    actions during construction of the model, while BuildCheck is used
    to test conditions and generate exceptions when the build process
    goes awry.

  - There is also a subtle change to the Param component. The following
    is now legal:

        def f(model):
            return 1.3
        model.x = Param(initialize=f)

    That is, when the Param object does not have an explicit index,
    then no index is passed to an initializer function (as is expected).

  - Adding 'summation', a function that computes multi-vector
    product sums:

       sum_i x[i]*y[i]*z[i]

  - Adding automatic computation of variable bounds based on the domain.
    If the domain set supports simple bounds, then they will be used to
    initialize the bounds of a variable.

  - Adding logic to ignore the generation of constraints if the
    constructor rule returns either 'None' or '0'.

  - Changed default domain of a Param to be Any, to be consistent with Set.

  - Rework of Pyomo to enable preprocessor actions to manage all
    post-instance-generation activities. This includes a simple preprocessor
    plugin, which simply applies preprocessor actions in an order specified
    by the action-specific ranks.  The problem writers are no longer
    responsible for how preprocessor actions take place.

    NOTE: These preprocessors are very much tailored to the needs of the
    NL and LP writers. We need to figure out a mechanism to tailoring
    preprocessors to specific target solvers (e.g. tailoring preprocessing
    for the NL writer, or tailoring preprocessing for MILP models).

  _ The Constraint and Objective classes were reworked to integrate
    their data into a single _data dictionary. This simplified
    the management of id and label information.

  - Extending the Constraint(model.A, rule=f) constructor semantics. This
    change allows the rule to return a dictionary when the constraint is
    indexed by one or more sets.

  - A revision to Pyomo semantics. Now, expressions are not evaluated
    when performing arithemetic operations (plus, times, etc).

  - A major rework of how component attributes are managed for
    NumericValue  objects and subclasses of this class. This was driven
    by the desire to add the Var.declare_attribute() method, which declares
    attributes for variables (which are akin to ampl suffix's).

    Most of these changes were motivated by inconsistencies that were
    observed within Pyomo, and the desire to better protect declared
    attributes. Now, attributes are stored with names that are unlikely
    to be used by end-users or other Pyomo developers. Also, declared
    attributes can now only be referenced directly. Thus, you cannot
    refer to x._value, but instead you must use x.value.

  - Reworked the way that 'empty' objectives and constraints are dealt
    with. By default, objectives and constraints with expr/body
    values of None are provided, which facilitates some aspects of
    preprocessing. But this triggered exceptions, which are now disabled.

  - Reworked how the '_equality' constraint attribute is managed.  This is
    now in the ConstraintData class, which required various changes.

  - Changed the pprint output for equality constraints to make it clear
    that both the upper and lower bounds are equal for these constraints.

  - Fixed bug in the definition of parameter names. When using a rule
    to define parameter values, the parameter name now reflex the index
    values for the parameter.

  - Major change of NumericalValue subclass semantics. The 'value' data
    member is not supported for expressions, constraints and objectives.
    These classes need to use the call method.  This simplifies the
    logic in their getattr/setattr methods.

  - Various code optimizations to improve the runtime performance of Pyomo.

  - A major rework of the Pyomo core to eliminates the use
    of getattr and setattr methods. Removing these led to a 1/3 reduction
    in runtime for some largish p-median test problems.  This change
    has had the following impact on Pyomo functionality:

    . No validation that values assigned to parameters or variables are valid

    . Cannot set all suffixes simultaneously

    . Cannot set lower/upper bounds simultaneously

    . No validation that suffixes are valid when their value is set

    Also, this effort led to a rework of the Param and Var classes. These
    are now segregated between Element and Array classes (similar to the
    Set class). This led to further optimizations of the logic in these
    classes. Unfortunately, it also led to the use of the _VarBase and
    _ParamBase in the PyomoModel to index components.

  - Changed order in which parameters are validated. Validation needs
    to occur after parameters are set. This is due to the semantics of
    the validation function: we want to allow the validation function to
    refer to the value as if it were set.

  - Depricating the use of the expression factory for algebraic expression
    types. These are now launched directly from the generate_expression()
    function.

  - Adding support for specifing options when launching solvers. For example:

    results = self.pico.solve(currdir+"bell3a.mps", options="maxCPUMinutes=0.1")

  - The value 'None' is accepted by all NumValue objects, and this
    indicates that the object has not been initialized.

  - ParamValue objects print their name, rather than their value.

  - Resolving an issue loading boolean data from a *.dat file.  Now,
    all true/false strings are changed to True/False values.

  - Rework of Pyomo to use the SolverManagerFactory. The default
    behavior is to use the 'serial' manager, which does local solves,
    but this supports extensibility for other solvers.


- SUCASA

  - Added an option to terminate SUCASA after the AMPL script is
    generated, but before PICO is called. This allows the AMPL script
    to be applied separately.

  - Rework of the files generated by SUCASA. Before, SUCASA generated
    three files:

    . app_milp.h/app_milp.cpp Define the derived MILP classes
    . app_extras.cpp Used to define the methods specialized by the user

    Now, SUCASA generates five files:

    . app_sucasa.h/app_sucasa.cpp Define the derived MILP classes
    . app_milp.h/app_milp.cpp Define a MILP from the code in *_sucasa.* files.
    . app_extras.cpp Used to define the methods specialized by the user

    The result, is that SUCASA now generates two derived solvers. BUT, the
    one that is exposed to the user can be customized without impacting
    the integration of the Info classes. Further, this segregation
    simplifies the class definitions that a user looks at; for example,
    there are no ugly ifdefs, and no references to the Info data.

  - A rework of the SUCASA API that is exported to the user. This new
    API allows users to register the vector of primal/dual values,
    which are access implicitly through the methods

      <name>_value()

  - Rework of the SUCASA Info API to ensure a consistent interface
    for sets, parameters, vars, etc.

  - Rework of the AMPL parser to guess the superset types for sets and
    parameters. This works on most common cases, but it's far from perfect.

  - Extended code generation to include parameter data.

  - Update of examples.


- PYSP

  - Initial integration of the Python Stochastic Programming (PySP) package.

  - Developed a variety of stochastic programming examples to illustrate
    the use of PYSP

  - Developed a PYSP user guide.


- General

  - Resolved Python 3.0 portability issues

  - Created a script create_pyomo_install, which uses virtualenv to
    automatically create the pyomo_install script, which automates the
    installation of pyomo.
