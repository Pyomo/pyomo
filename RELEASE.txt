We are pleased to announce the release of Pyomo 6.0.

Pyomo is a collection of Python software packages that supports a
diverse set of optimization capabilities for formulating and analyzing
optimization models.


The following are highlights of the 6.0 release series:

 - Improved stability and robustness of core Pyomo code and solver interfaces
 - Integration of Boolean variables into GDP
 - New packages: APPSI, structural model analysis, external grey box models

Note: As a major release, Pyomo 6.0 has certain backwards
incompatibilities with the 5.x series and the 2nd Edition of the Pyomo
Book.  Most notably:

 - Removed support for Python 2.7 or 3.5
 - Moved PySP into a separate package at https://github.com/Pyomo/pysp
 - Renamed "Simple" components to "Scalar" components
 - Removed support for implicit ranged inequalities (a <= m.x <= b)
 - Removed support for component reconstruct method
 - Removed support for casting relational expressions to bool

A full list of updates and changes is available in the CHANGELOG.txt

Enjoy!
